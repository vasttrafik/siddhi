            "text": "Quick Start Guide to Siddhi\n\n\nSiddhi\n is a 100% open source Java library that is thoroughly optimized for high performance. \nIt performs \nStream Processing\n and \nComplex Event Processing\n on real time data streams. \n\n\nSiddhi is used by many companies including Uber and eBay (via Apache Eagle). \nUber processes more than 20 billion \nevents per day using Siddhi\n for fraud analytics, and Siddhi is used in Apache Eagle as a policy enforcement engine.\n\n\nThis quick start guide contains the following six sections:\n\n\n\n\nStream Processing and Complex Event Processing Overview - about the \ndomain\n of Siddhi\n\n\nAn Overview of Siddhi - Explaining the basic \narchitecture\n\n\nUsing Siddhi for the First Time - how to \nset up\n the software\n\n\nSiddhi \u2018Hello World!\u2019 - Your \nFirst Siddhi Application\n\n\nSimulating Events - \nTesting\n your query with simulated events\n\n\nA Bit of Stream Processing - \ntemporal event processing\n\n\n\n\n1. Stream Processing and Complex Event Processing (CEP) Overview\n\n\nBefore diving into using Siddhi, let's first discuss Stream Processing \nand Complex Event Processing in brief so that we can identify the use-cases where Siddhi can be used.\n\n\nFirst let's understand what an event is through an example. \nIf we consider the transactions carried out via an ATM as a data \nstream, one withdrawal from it can be considered an event\n. This event contains data about the amount, time, account number etc. \nMany such transactions form a stream.\n\n\n\n\nForster\n defines Streaming Analytics as:\n\n\n\n\nSoftware that provides analytical operators to \norchestrate data flow\n, \ncalculate analytics\n, and \ndetect patterns\n on \nevent data \nfrom multiple, disparate live data sources\n to allow developers to build applications that \nsense, think, \nand act in real time\n.\n\n\n\n\nGartner\u2019s IT Glossary\n defines CEP as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\"CEP is a kind of computing in which \nincoming data about events is distilled into more useful, higher level \u201ccomplex\u201d \nevent data\n that provides insight into what is happening.\"\n\n\n\"\nCEP is event-driven\n because the computation is triggered by the receipt of event data. CEP is used for highly \ndemanding, continuous-intelligence applications that enhance situation awareness and support real-time decisions.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBasically, Siddhi receives data event-by-event and processes them in real time to produce meaningful information.\n\n\nSiddhi Can be used in the following use-cases:\n\n\n\n\nFraud Analytics \n\n\nMonitoring \n\n\nAnomaly Detection\n\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\n\nProcessing Customer Behaviour\n\n\n.. etc\n\n\n\n\n2. Overview of Siddhi\n\n\n\n\nAs indicated above, Siddhi can:\n\n\n\n\naccept event inputs from many different types of sources\n\n\nprocess them to generate insights\n\n\npublish them to many types of sinks.\n\n\n\n\nTo use Siddhi, you need to write the processing logic as a \nSiddhi Application\n in the \nSiddhi Streaming SQL\n \nlanguage which is discussed in the 4th section. After writing and starting \na Siddhi application\n, it:\n\n\n\n\nTakes data one-by-one as events\n\n\nProcesses the data in each event\n\n\nGenerates new high level events based on the processing done so far\n\n\nSends newly generated events as the output to streams.\n\n\n\n\n3. Using Siddhi for the First Time\n\n\nIn this section, we will be using the WSO2 Stream Processor(referred to as SP in the rest of this guide)\u200a\u2014\u200aa server version of Siddhi that has a\nsophisticated editor with a GUI (referred to as \n\u201cStream Processor Studio\u201d\n) where you can write your query and simulate events\nas a data stream.\n\n\nStep 1\n\u200a\u2014\u200aInstall \n\nOracle Java SE Development Kit (JDK)\n version 1.8. \n\n\nStep 2\n\u200a\u2014\u200a\nSet the JAVA_HOME\n environment \nvariable. \n\n\nStep 3\n\u200a\u2014\u200aDownload the latest \nWSO2 Stream Processor\n. \n\n\nStep 4\n\u200a\u2014\u200aExtract the downloaded zip and navigate to \nSP_HOME\n/bin\n. \n (\nSP_HOME\n refers to the extracted folder) \n\n\nStep 5\n\u200a\u2014\u200aIssue the following command in the command prompt (Windows) / terminal (Linux) \n\n\nFor Windows: editor.bat\nFor Linux: ./editor.sh\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more details about WSO2 Stream Processor, see its \nQuick Start Guide\n.\n\n\nAfter successfully starting the Stream Processor Studio, the terminal in Linux should look like as shown below:\n\n\n\n\nAfter starting the WSO2 Stream Processor, access the Stream Processor Studio by visiting the following link in your browser.\n\n\nhttp://localhost:9090/editor\n\n\n\n\n\nThis takes you to the Stream Processor Studio landing page.\n\n\n\n\n4. Siddhi \u2018Hello World!\u2019\u200a\u2014\u200aYour First Siddhi Application\n\n\nSiddhi Streaming SQL is a rich, compact, easy-to-learn SQL-like language. \nLet's first learn how to find the total\n of values \ncoming into a data stream and output the current running total value with each event. Siddhi has lot of in-built functions and extensions \navailable for complex analysis, but to get started, let's use a simple one. You can find more information about the Siddhi grammar \nand its functions in the \nSiddhi Query Guide\n.\n\n\nLet's \nconsider a scenario where we are loading cargo boxes into a ship\n. We need to keep track of the total \nweight of the cargo added. \nMeasuring the weight of a cargo box when loading is considered an event\n.\n\n\n\n\nWe can write a Siddhi program for the above scenario which has \n4 parts\n.\n\n\nPart 1\u200a\u2014\u200aGiving our Siddhi application a suitable name.\n This is a Siddhi routine. In this example, let's name our application as \n\n\u201cHelloWorldApp\u201d\n\n\n@App:name(\nHelloWorldApp\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nPart 2\u200a\u2014\u200aDefining the input stream.\n The stream needs to have a name and a schema defining the data that each incoming event should contain.\nThe event data attributes are expressed as name and type pairs. In this example:\n\n\n\n\nThe name of the input stream\u200a\u2014\u200a\n\u201cCargoStream\u201d\n \n\nThis contains only one data attribute:\n\n\nThe name of the data in each event\u200a\u2014\u200a\n\u201cweight\u201d\n\n\nType of the data \n\u201cweight\u201d\n\u200a\u2014\u200aint\n\n\n\n\ndefine stream CargoStream (weight int);\n\n\n\n\n\nPart 3 - Defining the output stream.\n This has the same info as the previous definition with an additional \n\ntotalWeight\n attribute that contains the total weight calculated so far. Here, we need to add a \n\n\"sink\"\n  to log the \nOutputStream\n so that we can observe the output values. (\nSink is the Siddhi way to publish \nstreams to external systems.\n This particular \nlog\n type sink just logs the stream events. To learn more about sinks, see \n\nsink\n)\n\n\n@sink(type=\nlog\n, prefix=\nLOGGER\n)\ndefine stream OutputStream(weight int, totalWeight long);\n\n\n\n\n\nPart 4\u200a\u2014\u200aThe actual Siddhi query.\n Here we need to specify the following:\n\n\n\n\nA name for the query\u200a\u2014\u200a\n\u201cHelloWorldQuery\u201d\n\n\nWhich stream should be taken into processing\u200a\u2014\u200a\n\u201cCargoStream\u201d\n\n\nWhat data we require in the output stream\u200a\u2014\u200a\n\u201cweight\u201d\n, \n\u201ctotalWeight\u201d\n\n\nHow the output should be calculated - by calculating the \nsum\n of the the \nweight\ns  \n\n\nWhich stream should be populated with the output\u200a\u2014\u200a\n\u201cOutputStream\u201d\n\n\n\n\n@info(name=\nHelloWorldQuery\n)\nfrom CargoStream\nselect weight, sum(weight) as totalWeight\ninsert into OutputStream;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Simulating Events\n\n\nThe Stream Processor Studio has in-built support to simulate events. You can do it via the \n\u201cEvent Simulator\u201d\n \npanel at the left of the Stream Processor Studio.

A Bit of Stream Processing - \ntemporal event processing\n\n\nThis section demonstrates how to carry out \ntemporal window processing\n with Siddhi.\n\n\nUpto this point, we have been carrying out the processing by having only the running sum value in-memory. \nNo events were stored during this processing. \n\n\nWindow processing\n \nis a method that allows us to store some events in-memory for a given period so that we can perform operations \nsuch as calculating the average, maximum, etc values within them.\n\n\nLet's imagine that when we are loading cargo boxes into the ship \nwe need to keep track of the average weight of \nthe recently loaded boxes\n so that we can balance the weight across the ship. \nFor this purpose, let's try to find the \naverage weight of last three boxes\n of each event.\n\n\n\n\nFor window processing, we need to modify our query as follows:\n\n\n@info(name=\nHelloWorldQuery\n) \nfrom CargoStream#window.length(3)\nselect weight, sum(weight) as totalWeight, avg(weight) as averageWeight\ninsert into OutputStream;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfrom CargoStream#window.length(3)\n - Here, we are specifying that the last 3 events should be kept in memory for processing.\n\n\navg(weight) as averageWeight\n - Here, we are calculating the average of events stored in the window and producing the \naverage value as \n\"averageWeight\"\n (Note: Now the \nsum\n also calculates the \ntotalWeight\n based on the last three events).\n\n\n\n\nWe also need to modify the \n\"OutputStream\"\n definition to accommodate the new \n\"averageWeight\"\n.\n\n\ndefine stream OutputStream(weight int, totalWeight long, averageWeight double);\n\n\n\n\n\nThe updated Siddhi Application should look as shown below:\n\n\n\n\nNow you can send events using the Event Simulator and observe the log to see the sum and average of the weights of the last three \ncargo events.\n\n\nIt is also notable that the defined \nlength window\n only keeps 3 events in-memory. When the 4th event arrives, the \nfirst event in the window is removed from memory. This ensures that the memory usage does not grow beyond a specific limit. There are also other \nimplementations done in Siddhi  to reduce the memory consumption.

First let's understand what an event is through an example.  If we consider the transactions carried out via an ATM as a data \nstream, one withdrawal from it can be considered an event . This event contains data about the amount, time, account number etc. \nMany such transactions form a stream.   Forster  defines Streaming Analytics as:   Software that provides analytical operators to  orchestrate data flow ,  calculate analytics , and  detect patterns  on \nevent data  from multiple, disparate live data sources  to allow developers to build applications that  sense, think, \nand act in real time .   Gartner\u2019s IT Glossary  defines CEP as follows:   \"CEP is a kind of computing in which  incoming data about events is distilled into more useful, higher level \u201ccomplex\u201d \nevent data  that provides insight into what is happening.\"  \" CEP is event-driven  because the computation is triggered by the receipt of event data. CEP is used for highly \ndemanding, continuous-intelligence applications that enhance situation awareness and support real-time decisions.\"    Basically, Siddhi receives data event-by-event and processes them in real time to produce meaningful information.  Siddhi Can be used in the following use-cases:   Fraud Analytics   Monitoring   Anomaly Detection  Sentiment Analysis  Processing Customer Behaviour  .. etc",

Let's first learn how to find the total  of values \ncoming into a data stream and output the current running total value with each event. Siddhi has lot of in-built functions and extensions \navailable for complex analysis, but to get started, let's use a simple one. You can find more information about the Siddhi grammar \nand its functions in the  Siddhi Query Guide .  Let's  consider a scenario where we are loading cargo boxes into a ship . We need to keep track of the total \nweight of the cargo added.  Measuring the weight of a cargo box when loading is considered an event .   We can write a Siddhi program for the above scenario which has  4 parts .  Part 1\u200a\u2014\u200aGiving our Siddhi application a suitable name.  This is a Siddhi routine. In this example, let's name our application as  \u201cHelloWorldApp\u201d  @App:name( HelloWorldApp )  Part 2\u200a\u2014\u200aDefining the input stream.  The stream needs to have a name and a schema defining the data that each incoming event should contain.\nThe event data attributes are expressed as name and type pairs. In this example:   The name of the input stream\u200a\u2014\u200a \u201cCargoStream\u201d   \nThis contains only one data attribute:  The name of the data in each event\u200a\u2014\u200a \u201cweight\u201d  Type of the data  \u201cweight\u201d \u200a\u2014\u200aint   define stream CargoStream (weight int);  Part 3 - Defining the output stream.  This has the same info as the previous definition with an additional  totalWeight  attribute that contains the total weight calculated so far. Here, we need to add a  \"sink\"   to log the  OutputStream  so that we can observe the output values. ( Sink is the Siddhi way to publish \nstreams to external systems.  This particular  log  type sink just logs the stream events. To learn more about sinks, see  sink )  @sink(type= log , prefix= LOGGER )\ndefine stream OutputStream(weight int, totalWeight long);  Part 4\u200a\u2014\u200aThe actual Siddhi query.  Here we need to specify the following:   A name for the query\u200a\u2014\u200a \u201cHelloWorldQuery\u201d  Which stream should be taken into processing\u200a\u2014\u200a \u201cCargoStream\u201d  What data we require in the output stream\u200a\u2014\u200a \u201cweight\u201d ,  \u201ctotalWeight\u201d  How the output should be calculated - by calculating the  sum  of the the  weight s    Which stream should be populated with the output\u200a\u2014\u200a \u201cOutputStream\u201d   @info(name= HelloWorldQuery )\nfrom CargoStream\nselect weight, sum(weight) as totalWeight\ninsert into OutputStream;",

The required dependencies can be downloaded from \nhere\n.\n* Create a new Java class in the Maven project.\n\n\nStep 2: Creating Siddhi Application\n\n\nA Siddhi application is a self contained execution entity that defines how data is captured, processed and sent out.  \n\n\n\n\nCreate a Siddhi Application by defining a stream definition E.g.\nStockEventStream\n defining the format of the incoming\n events, and by defining a Siddhi query as follows.\n\n\n\n\n  \nString\n \nsiddhiApp\n \n=\n \ndefine stream StockEventStream (symbol string, price float, volume long); \n \n+\n \n                     \n \n \n+\n\n                     \n@info(name = \nquery1\n) \n \n+\n\n                     \nfrom StockEventStream#window.time(5 sec)  \n \n+\n\n                     \nselect symbol, sum(price) as price, sum(volume) as volume \n \n+\n\n                     \ngroup by symbol \n \n+\n\n                     \ninsert into AggregateStockStream ;\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Siddhi query groups the events by symbol and calculates aggregates such as the sum for price and sum of volume \n  for the last 5 seconds time window. Then it inserts the results into a stream named \nAggregateStockStream\n. \n\n\nStep 3: Creating Siddhi Application Runtime\n\n\nThis step involves creating a runtime representation of a Siddhi application.\n\n\nSiddhiManager\n \nsiddhiManager\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nSiddhiManager\n();\n\n\nSiddhiAppRuntime\n \nsiddhiAppRuntime\n \n=\n \nsiddhiManager\n.\ncreateSiddhiAppRuntime\n(\nsiddhiApp\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Siddhi Manager parses the Siddhi application and provides you with an Siddhi application runtime. \nThis Siddhi application runtime can be used to add callbacks and input handlers such that you can \nprogrammatically invoke the Siddhi application.\n\n\nStep 4: Registering a Callback\n\n\nYou can register a callback to the Siddhi application runtime in order to receive the results once the events are processed. There are two types of callbacks:\n\n\n\n\nQuery callback\n: This subscribes to a query.\n\n\nStream callback\n: This subscribes to an event stream.\nIn this example, a Stream callback is added to the \nAggregateStockStream\n to capture the processed events.\n\n\n\n\nsiddhiAppRuntime\n.\naddCallback\n(\nAggregateStockStream\n,\n \nnew\n \nStreamCallback\n()\n \n{\n\n           \n@Override\n\n           \npublic\n \nvoid\n \nreceive\n(\nEvent\n[]\n \nevents\n)\n \n{\n\n               \nEventPrinter\n.\nprint\n(\nevents\n);\n\n           \n}\n\n       \n});\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, once the results are generated they are sent to the receive method of this callback. An event printer is added \ninside this callback to print the incoming events for demonstration purposes.\n\n\nStep 5: Sending Events\n\n\nIn order to programmatically send events from the stream you need to obtain it's an input handler as follows:\n\n\nInputHandler\n \ninputHandler\n \n=\n \nsiddhiAppRuntime\n.\ngetInputHandler\n(\nStockEventStream\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the following code to start the Siddhi application runtime, send events and to shutdown Siddhi:\n\n\n//Start SiddhiApp runtime\n\n\nsiddhiAppRuntime\n.\nstart\n();\n\n\n\n//Sending events to Siddhi\n\n\ninputHandler\n.\nsend\n(\nnew\n \nObject\n[]{\nIBM\n,\n \n100\nf\n,\n \n100L\n});\n\n\nThread\n.\nsleep\n(\n1000\n);\n\n\ninputHandler\n.\nsend\n(\nnew\n \nObject\n[]{\nIBM\n,\n \n200\nf\n,\n \n300L\n});\n\n\ninputHandler\n.\nsend\n(\nnew\n \nObject\n[]{\nWSO2\n,\n \n60\nf\n,\n \n200L\n});\n\n\nThread\n.\nsleep\n(\n1000\n);\n\n\ninputHandler\n.\nsend\n(\nnew\n \nObject\n[]{\nWSO2\n,\n \n70\nf\n,\n \n400L\n});\n\n\ninputHandler\n.\nsend\n(\nnew\n \nObject\n[]{\nGOOG\n,\n \n50\nf\n,\n \n30L\n});\n\n\nThread\n.\nsleep\n(\n1000\n);\n\n\ninputHandler\n.\nsend\n(\nnew\n \nObject\n[]{\nIBM\n,\n \n200\nf\n,\n \n400L\n});\n\n\nThread\n.\nsleep\n(\n2000\n);\n\n\ninputHandler\n.\nsend\n(\nnew\n \nObject\n[]{\nWSO2\n,\n \n70\nf\n,\n \n50L\n});\n\n\nThread\n.\nsleep\n(\n2000\n);\n\n\ninputHandler\n.\nsend\n(\nnew\n \nObject\n[]{\nWSO2\n,\n \n80\nf\n,\n \n400L\n});\n\n\ninputHandler\n.\nsend\n(\nnew\n \nObject\n[]{\nGOOG\n,\n \n60\nf\n,\n \n30L\n});\n\n\nThread\n.\nsleep\n(\n1000\n);\n\n\n\n//Shutdown SiddhiApp runtime\n\n\nsiddhiAppRuntime\n.\nshutdown\n();\n\n\n\n//Shutdown Siddhi\n\n\nsiddhiManager\n.\nshutdown\n();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the events are sent, you can see the output logged by the event printer.\n\n\nFind the executable Java code of this example \nhere\n \n\n\nFor more code examples, see \nquick start samples for Siddhi\n.\n\n\nSystem Requirements\n\n\n\n\nMinimum memory - 500 MB (based on in-memory data stored for processing)\n\n\nProcessor      - Pentium 800MHz or equivalent at minimum\n\n\nJava SE Development Kit 1.8 (1.7 for 3.x version)\n\n\nTo build Siddhi from the Source distribution, it is necessary that you have\n   JDK 1.8 version (1.7 for 3.x version) or later and Maven 3.0.4 or later",

Stored data can be backed by \nIn-Memory\n, \nRDBMs\n, \nMongoDB\n, etc. to be accessed and manipulated at runtime.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuery\n\n\nA logical construct that processes events in streaming manner by combining existing streams and/or tables, and generates events to an output stream or table. A query consumes one or more input streams, and zero or one table. Then it processes these events in a streaming manner and publishes the output events to streams or tables for further processing or to generate notifications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource\n\n\nA contract that consumes data from external sources (such as \nTCP\n, \nKafka\n, \nHTTP\n, etc)in the form of events, then converts each event (which can be in \nXML\n, \nJSON\n, \nbinary\n, etc. format) to a Siddhi event, and passes that to a Stream for processing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSink\n\n\nA contract that takes events arriving at a stream, maps them to a predefined data format (such as \nXML\n, \nJSON\n, \nbinary\n, etc), and publishes them to external endpoints (such as \nE-mail\n, \nTCP\n, \nKafka\n, \nHTTP\n, etc).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput Handler\n\n\nA mechanism to programmatically inject events into streams.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStream/Query Callback\n\n\nA mechanism to programmatically consume output events from streams and queries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPartition\n\n\nA logical container that isolates the processing of queries based on partition keys.

A simple query with all three sections is as follows.\n\n\nfrom\n \ninput\n \nstream\n \n\nselect\n \nattribute\n \nname\n,\n \nattribute\n \nname\n,\n \n...\n\n\ninsert\n \ninto\n \noutput\n \nstream\n/\ntable\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nThis query included in a Siddhi Application consumes events from the \nTempStream\n stream (that is already defined) and outputs the room temperature and the room number to the \nRoomTempStream\n stream.\n\n\ndefine\n \nstream\n \nTempStream\n \n(\ndeviceID\n \nlong\n,\n \nroomNo\n \nint\n,\n \ntemp\n \ndouble\n);\n\n\n\nfrom\n \nTempStream\n \n\nselect\n \nroomNo\n,\n \ntemp\n\n\ninsert\n \ninto\n \nRoomTempStream\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInferred Stream\n\n\nHere, the \nRoomTempStream\n is an inferred Stream, which means it can be used as any other defined stream \nwithout explicitly defining its stream definition.

Therefore, in order to join two streams, they need to be connected to a window so that there is a pool of events that can be used for joining. Joins also accept conditions to join the appropriate events from each stream.\n\n\nDuring the joining process each incoming event of each stream is matched against all the events in the other \nstream's window based on the given condition, and the output events are generated for all the matching event pairs.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nJoin can also be performed with \nstored data\n, \naggregation\n or externally \ndefined windows\n.\n\n\n\n\nSyntax\n\n\nThe syntax for a join is as follows:\n\n\nfrom\n \ninput\n \nstream\n#\nwindow\n.\nwindow\n \nname\n(\nparameter\n,\n \n...\n \n)\n \n{\nunidirectional\n}\n \n{\nas\n \nreference\n}\n\n         \njoin\n \ninput\n \nstream\n#\nwindow\n.\nwindow\n \nname\n(\nparameter\n,\n  \n...\n \n)\n \n{\nunidirectional\n}\n \n{\nas\n \nreference\n}\n\n    \non\n \njoin\n \ncondition\n\n\nselect\n \nattribute\n \nname\n,\n \nattribute\n \nname\n,\n \n...\n\n\ninsert\n \ninto\n \noutput\n \nstream\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, the \njoin condition\n allows you to match the attributes from both the streams. \n\n\nUnidirectional join operation\n\n\nBy default, events arriving at either stream can trigger the joining process. However, if you want to control the \njoin execution, you can add the \nunidirectional\n keyword next to a stream in the join definition as depicted in the \nsyntax in order to enable that stream to trigger the join operation. Here, events arriving at other stream only update the \n window of that stream, and this stream does not trigger the join operation.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe \nunidirectional\n keyword cannot be applied to both the input streams because the default behaviour already allows both streams to trigger the join operation.\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nAssuming that the temperature of regulators are updated every minute. \nFollowing is a Siddhi App the controls the temperature regulators if they are not already \non\n for all the rooms with a room temperature greater than 30 degrees.  \n\n\ndefine\n \nstream\n \nTempStream\n(\ndeviceID\n \nlong\n,\n \nroomNo\n \nint\n,\n \ntemp\n \ndouble\n);\n\n\ndefine\n \nstream\n \nRegulatorStream\n(\ndeviceID\n \nlong\n,\n \nroomNo\n \nint\n,\n \nisOn\n \nbool\n);\n\n\n\nfrom\n \nTempStream\n[\ntemp\n \n \n30\n.\n0\n]\n#\nwindow\n.\ntime\n(\n1\n \nmin\n)\n \nas\n \nT\n\n  \njoin\n \nRegulatorStream\n[\nisOn\n \n==\n \nfalse\n]\n#\nwindow\n.\nlength\n(\n1\n)\n \nas\n \nR\n\n  \non\n \nT\n.\nroomNo\n \n==\n \nR\n.\nroomNo\n\n\nselect\n \nT\n.\nroomNo\n,\n \nR\n.\ndeviceID\n,\n \nstart\n \nas\n \naction\n\n\ninsert\n \ninto\n \nRegulatorActionStream\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupported join types\n \n\n\nFollowing are the supported operations of a join clause.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInner join (join)\n \n\n\nThis is the default behaviour of a join operation. \njoin\n is used as the keyword to join both the streams.

to limit the output to avoid overloading the subsequent executions, and to remove unnecessary information.\n\n\nSyntax\n\n\nThe syntax of an output rate limiting configuration is as follows:\n\n\nfrom\n \ninput\n \nstream\n \n...\n\n\nselect\n \nattribute\n \nname\n,\n \nattribute\n \nname\n,\n \n...\n\n\noutput\n \nrate\n \nlimiting\n \nconfiguration\n\n\ninsert\n \ninto\n \noutput\n \nstream\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSiddhi supports three types of output rate limiting configurations as explained in the following table: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRate limiting configuration\n\n\nSyntax\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on time\n\n\noutput event\n every \ntime interval\n\n\nThis outputs \noutput event\n every \ntime interval\n time interval.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on number of events\n\n\noutput event\n every \nevent interval\n events\n\n\nThis outputs \noutput event\n for every \nevent interval\n number of events.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSnapshot based output\n\n\nsnapshot every \ntime interval\n\n\nThis outputs all events in the window (or the last event if no window is defined in the query) for every given \ntime interval\n time interval.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere the \noutput event\n specifies the event(s) that should be returned as the output of the query. \nThe possible values are as follows:\n\n \nfirst\n : Only the first event processed by the query during the specified time interval/sliding window is emitted.\n\n \nlast\n : Only the last event processed by the query during the specified time interval/sliding window is emitted.\n* \nall\n : All the events processed by the query during the specified time interval/sliding window are emitted. \nWhen no \noutput event\n is defined, \nall\n is used by default.\n\n\nExamples\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturning events based on the number of events\n\n\nHere, events are emitted every time the specified number of events arrive. You can also specify whether to emit only the first event/last event, or all the events out of the events that arrived.\n\n\nIn this example, the last temperature per sensor is emitted for every 10 events.\n\n\n\nfrom TempStreamselect \nselect temp, deviceID\ngroup by deviceID\noutput last every 10 events\ninsert into LowRateTempStream;    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturning events based on time\n\n\nHere events are emitted for every predefined time interval. You can also specify whether to emit only the first event, last event, or all events out of the events that arrived during the specified time interval.\n\n\nIn this example, emits all temperature events every 10 seconds  \n\n\n\nfrom TempStreamoutput \noutput every 10 sec\ninsert into LowRateTempStream;    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturning a periodic snapshot of events\n\n\nThis method works best with windows. When an input stream is connected to a window, snapshot rate limiting emits all the current events that have arrived and do not have corresponding expired events for every predefined time interval. \nIf the input stream is not connected to a window, only the last current event for each predefined time interval is emitted.\n\n\nThis query emits a snapshot of the events in a time window of 5 seconds every 1 second. \n\n\n\nfrom TempStream#window.time(5 sec)\noutput snapshot every 1 sec\ninsert into SnapshotTempStream;    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPartition\n\n\nPartitions divide streams and queries into isolated groups in  order to process them in parallel and in isolation. \nA partition can contain one or more queries and there can be multiple instances where the same queries and streams are replicated for each partition. \nEach partition is tagged with a partition key. Those partitions only process the events that match the corresponding partition key. \n\n\nPurpose\n \n\n\nPartitions allow you to process the events groups in isolation so that event processing can be performed using the same set of queries for each group. \n\n\nPartition key generation\n\n\nA partition key can be generated in the following two methods:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPartition by value\n\n\nThis is created by generating unique values using input stream attributes.\n\n\nSyntax\n\n\n\npartition with ( \nexpression\n of \nstream name\n, \nexpression\n of \nstream name\n, ... )\nbegin\n    \nquery\n\n    \nquery\n\n    ...\nend; \n\n\nExample\n\n\nThis query calculates the maximum temperature recorded within the last 10 events per \ndeviceID\n.\n\n\n\npartition with ( deviceID of TempStream )\nbegin\n    from TempStream#window.length(10)\n    select roomNo, deviceID, max(temp) as maxTemp\n    insert into DeviceTempStream;\nend;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPartition by range\n\n\nThis is created by mapping each partition key to a range condition of the input streams numerical attribute.\n\n\nSyntax\n\n\n\npartition with ( \ncondition\n as \npartition key\n or \ncondition\n as \npartition key\n or ... of \nstream name\n, ... )\nbegin\n    \nquery\n\n    \nquery\n\n    ...\nend;\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nThis query calculates the average temperature for the last 10 minutes per office area.\n\n\n\npartition with ( roomNo \n= 1030 as 'serverRoom' or \n                 roomNo \n 1030 and roomNo \n= 330 as 'officeRoom' or \n                 roomNo \n 330 as 'lobby' of TempStream)\nbegin\n    from TempStream#window.time(10 min)\n    select roomNo, deviceID, avg(temp) as avgTemp\n    insert into AreaTempStream\nend;\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInner Stream\n\n\nQueries inside a partition block can use inner streams to communicate with each other while preserving partition isolation.\nInner streams are denoted by a \"#\" placed before the stream name, and these streams cannot be accessed outside a partition block. \n\n\nPurpose\n\n\nInner streams allow you to connect queries within the partition block so that the output of a query can be used as an input only by another query \nwithin the same partition. Therefore, you do not need to repartition the streams if they are communicating within the partition.\n\n\nExample\n\n\nThis partition calculates the average temperature of every 10 events for each sensor, and sends an output to the \nDeviceTempIncreasingStream\n stream if the consecutive average temperature values increase by more than \n5 degrees.\n\n\n\npartition with ( deviceID of TempStream )\nbegin\n    from TempStream#window.lengthBatch(10)\n    select roomNo, deviceID, avg(temp) as avgTemp\n    insert into #AvgTempStream\n\n    from every (e1=#AvgTempStream),e2=#AvgTempStream[e1.avgTemp + 5 \n<\n avgTemp]\n    select e1.deviceID, e1.avgTemp as initialAvgTemp, e2.avgTemp as finalAvgTemp\n    insert into DeviceTempIncreasingStream\nend;\n\n\n\n\nTable\n\n\nA table is a stored version of an stream or a table of events. Its schema is defined via the \ntable definition\n that is\nsimilar to a stream definition. These events are by default stored \nin-memory\n, but Siddhi also provides store extensions to work with data/events stored in various data stores through the \ntable abstraction.\n\n\nPurpose\n\n\nTables allow Siddhi to work with stored events. By defining a schema for tables Siddhi enables them to be processed by queries using their defined attributes with the streaming data. You can also interactively query the state of the stored events in the table.\n\n\nSyntax\n\n\nThe syntax for a new table definition is as follows:\n\n\ndefine\n \nstream\n \nstream\n \nname\n \n(\nattribute\n \nname\n \nattribute\n \ntype\n,\n \nattribute\n \nname\n \nattribute\n \ntype\n,\n \n...\n \n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following parameters are configured in a table definition:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntable name\n\n\nThe name of the table defined. (\nPascalCase\n is used for table name as a convention.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nattribute name\n\n\nThe schema of the table is defined by its attributes with uniquely identifiable attribute names (\ncamalCase\n is used for attribute names as a convention.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nattribute type\n\n\nThe type of each attribute defined in the schema. \n This can be \nSTRING\n, \nINT\n, \nLONG\n, \nDOUBLE\n, \nFLOAT\n, \nBOOL\n or \nOBJECT\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nThe following defines a table named \nRoomTypeTable\n with \nroomNo\n and \ntype\n attributes of data types \nint\n and \nstring\n respectively.\n\n\ndefine\n \ntable\n \nRoomTypeTable\n \n(\n \nroomNo\n \nint\n,\n \ntype\n \nstring\n \n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimary Keys\n\n\nTables can be configured with primary keys to avoid the duplication of data. \n\n\nPrimary keys are configured by including the \n@PrimaryKey( 'key1', 'key2' )\n annotation to the table definition. \nEach event table configuration can have only one \n@PrimaryKey\n annotation. \nThe number of attributes supported differ based on the table implementations. When more than one attribute \n is used for the primary key, the uniqueness of the events stored in the table is determined based on the combination of values for those attributes.\n\n\nExamples\n\n\nThis query creates an event table with the \nsymbol\n attribute as the primary key. \nTherefore each entry in this table must have a unique value for \nsymbol\n attribute.\n\n\n@\nPrimaryKey\n(\nsymbol\n)\n\n\ndefine\n \ntable\n \nStockTable\n \n(\nsymbol\n \nstring\n,\n \nprice\n \nfloat\n,\n \nvolume\n \nlong\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndexes\n\n\nIndexes allow tables to be searched/modified much faster. \n\n\nIndexes are configured by including the \n@Index( 'key1', 'key2' )\n annotation to the table definition.\n Each event table configuration can have 0-1 \n@Index\n annotations. \n Support for the \n@Index\n annotation and the number of attributes supported differ based on the table implementations. \n When more then one attribute is used for index, each one of them is used to index the table for fast access of the data. \n Indexes can be configured together with primary keys. \n\n\nExamples\n\n\nThis query creates an indexed event table named \nRoomTypeTable\n with the \nroomNo\n attribute as the index key.\n\n\n@\nIndex\n(\nroomNo\n)\n\n\ndefine\n \ntable\n \nRoomTypeTable\n \n(\nroomNo\n \nint\n,\n \ntype\n \nstring\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperators on Table\n\n\nThe following operators can be performed on tables.\n\n\nInsert\n\n\nThis allows events to be inserted into tables. This is similar to inserting events into streams. \n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nIf the table is defined with primary keys, and if you insert duplicate data, primary key constrain violations can occur. \nIn such cases use the \nupdate or insert\n operation. \n\n\n\n\nSyntax\n\n\nfrom\n \ninput\n \nstream\n \n\nselect\n \nattribute\n \nname\n,\n \nattribute\n \nname\n,\n \n...\n\n\ninsert\n \ninto\n \ntable\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar to streams, you need to use the \ncurrent events\n, \nexpired events\n or the \nall events\n keyword between \ninsert\n and \ninto\n keywords in order to insert only the specific output event types. \nFor more information, see \noutput event type\n.\n\n\nExample\n\n\nThis query inserts all the events from the \nTempStream\n stream to the \nTempTable\n table.\n\n\nfrom\n \nTempStream\n\n\nselect\n \n*\n\n\ninsert\n \ninto\n \nTempTable\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin (Table)\n\n\nThis allows a stream to retrieve information from a table in a streaming manner.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nJoins can also be performed with \ntwo streams\n, \naggregation\n or against externally \ndefined windows\n.\n\n\n\n\nSyntax\n\n\nfrom\n \ninput\n \nstream\n \njoin\n \ntable\n\n    \non\n \ncondition\n\n\nselect\n \n(\ninput\n \nstream\n|\ntable\n).\nattribute\n \nname\n,\n \n(\ninput\n \nstream\n|\ntable\n).\nattribute\n \nname\n,\n \n...\n\n\ninsert\n \ninto\n \noutput\n \nstream\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nA table can only be joint with a stream.

Its schema is defined via the \naggregation definition\n.\n\n\nPurpose\n\n\nIncremental aggregation allows you to retrieve the aggregate value for different time durations. \nThat is, it allows you to obtain aggregates such as \nsum\n, \ncount\n, \navg\n, \nmin\n, \nmax\n, and \ncount\n) \nof stream attributes for durations such as \nsec\n, \nmin\n, \nhour\n, etc. \n\n\nThis is of considerable importance in many Analytics scenarios because aggregate values are often needed for several time periods. \nFurthermore, this ensures that the aggregations are not lost due to unexpected system failures because aggregates can be stored in different persistence \nstores\n.\n\n\nSyntax\n\n\n@\nstore\n(\ntype\n=\nstore type\n,\n \n...)\n\n\ndefine\n \naggregation\n \naggregator\n \nname\n\n\nfrom\n \ninput\n \nstream\n\n\nselect\n \nattribute\n \nname\n,\n \naggregate\n \nfunction\n(\nattribute\n \nname\n)\n \nas\n \nattribute\n \nname\n,\n \n...\n\n    \ngroup\n \nby\n \nattribute\n \nname\n\n    \naggregate\n \nby\n \ntimestamp\n \nattribute\n \nevery\n \ntime\n \nperiods\n \n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above syntax includes the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@store\n\n\nThis annotation is used to refer to the data store where the calculated \naggregate results are stored.

Purpose  Each Siddhi Application is an isolated processing unit that allows you to deploy and execute queries independent of other Siddhi applications in the system.  The following diagram depicts how  event flows  work with some of the key Siddhi Streaming SQL elements \nof the Siddhi Application.   Below table provides brief description of a few key elements in the Siddhi Streaming SQL Language.     Elements  Description      Stream  A logical series of events ordered in time with a uniquely identifiable name, and set of defined attributes with specific data types defining its schema.    Event  An event is associated with only one stream, and all events of that stream have an identical set of attributes that are assigned specific types (or the same schema). An event contains a timestamp and set of attribute values according to the schema.    Table  A structured representation of data stored with a defined schema. Stored data can be backed by  In-Memory ,  RDBMs ,  MongoDB , etc. to be accessed and manipulated at runtime.    Query  A logical construct that processes events in streaming manner by combining existing streams and/or tables, and generates events to an output stream or table. A query consumes one or more input streams, and zero or one table. Then it processes these events in a streaming manner and publishes the output events to streams or tables for further processing or to generate notifications.    Source  A contract that consumes data from external sources (such as  TCP ,  Kafka ,  HTTP , etc)in the form of events, then converts each event (which can be in  XML ,  JSON ,  binary , etc. format) to a Siddhi event, and passes that to a Stream for processing.    Sink  A contract that takes events arriving at a stream, maps them to a predefined data format (such as  XML ,  JSON ,  binary , etc), and publishes them to external endpoints (such as  E-mail ,  TCP ,  Kafka ,  HTTP , etc).    Input Handler  A mechanism to programmatically inject events into streams.    Stream/Query Callback  A mechanism to programmatically consume output events from streams and queries.    Partition  A logical container that isolates the processing of queries based on partition keys. Here, a separate instance of queries is generated for each partition key to achieve isolation.    Inner Stream  A positionable stream that connects portioned queries within their partitions, preserving isolation.     Grammar  An element of Siddhi SQL can be composed together as a script in a Siddhi application, Here each construct must be separated \nby a semicolon  ( ; )  as shown in the below syntax.   siddhi app   : \n         app annotation  * \n        (  stream definition  |  table definition  | ... ) + \n        (  query  |  partition  ) +\n        ;  Example \nSiddhi Application named  Temperature-Analytics  defined with a stream named  TempStream  and a query \nnamed  5minAvgQuery  for processing it.  @ app : name ( Temperature-Analytics )  define   stream   TempStream   ( deviceID   long ,   roomNo   int ,   temp   double );  @ name ( 5minAvgQuery )  from   TempStream # window . time ( 5   min )  select   roomNo ,   avg ( temp )   as   avgTemp \n   group   by   room  insert   into   OutputStream ;",

Purpose  By defining a schema it unifies common types of events together. This enables them to be processed via queries using their defined attributes in a streaming manner, and allow sinks and sources to map events to/from various data formats.  Syntax  The syntax for defining a new stream is as follows.  define   stream   stream   name   ( attribute   name   attribute   type ,   attribute   name   attribute   type ,   ...   );   The following parameters are configured in a stream definition.

            "text": "Sources receive events via multiple transports and in various data formats, and direct them into streams for processing.  A source configuration allows you to define a mapping in order to convert each incoming event from its native data format to a Siddhi event. When customizations to such mappings are not provided, Siddhi assumes that the arriving event adheres to the predefined format based on the stream definition and the selected message format.   Purpose  Source allows Siddhi to consume events from external systems, and map the events to adhere to the associated stream.   Syntax  To configure a stream that consumes events via a source, add the source configuration to a stream definition by adding the  @source  annotation with the required parameter values. \nThe source syntax is as follows:  @ source ( type = source_type ,   static . option . key1 = static_option_value1 ,   static . option . keyN = static_option_valueN , \n     @ map ( type = map_type ,   static . option_key1 = static_option_value1 ,   static . option . keyN = static_option_valueN , \n         @ attributes (   attributeN = attribute_mapping_N ,   attribute1 = attribute_mapping_1 ) \n     )  )  define   stream   stream_name   ( attribute1   Type1 ,   attributeN   TypeN );   This syntax includes the following annotations.

For detailed information about the parameters see the documentation for the relevant source.  The following is the list of source types that are currently supported:   HTTP   (Only works in WSO2 Stream Processor)  Kafka  TCP  In-memory  WSO2Event  Email   (Only works in WSO2 Stream Processor)  JMS   (Only works in WSO2 Stream Processor)  File   (Only works in WSO2 Stream Processor)  RabbitMQ  MQTT   Source Mapper  Each  @source  configuration has a mapping denoted by the  @map  annotation that converts the incoming messages format to Siddhi events.  The  type  parameter of the  @map  defines the map type to be used to map the data. The other parameters to be \nconfigured depends on the mapper selected. Some of these parameters are optional.  \nFor detailed information about the parameters see the documentation for the relevant mapper.   Tip  When the  @map  annotation is not provided,  @map(type='passThrough')  is used as default. This default mapper type can be used when source consumes Siddhi events and when it does not need any mappings.   Map Attributes  @attributes  is an optional annotation used with  @map  to define custom mapping. When  @attributes  is not provided, each mapper\nassumes that the incoming events  adhere to its own default data format. By adding the  @attributes  annotation, you \ncan configure mappers to extract data from the incoming message selectively, and assign them to attributes.   There are two ways you can configure map attributes.    Defining attributes as keys and mapping content as values in the following format:   @attributes( attributeN='mapping_N', attribute1='mapping_1')    Defining the mapping content of all attributes in the same order as how the attributes are defined in stream definition:   @attributes( 'mapping_1', 'mapping_N')     Supported Mapping Types  The following is a list of currently supported source mapping types:   WSO2Event  XML  TEXT  JSON  Binary  Key Value   Example  This query receives events via the  HTTP  source in the  JSON  data format, and directs them to the  InputStream  stream for processing. \nHere the HTTP source is configured to receive events on all network interfaces on the  8080 port, on the  foo  context, and \nit is secured via basic authentication.  @ source ( type = http ,   receiver . url = http://0.0.0.0:8080/foo ,   is . basic . auth . enabled = true ,  \n   @ map ( type = json ))  define   stream   InputStream   ( name   string ,   age   int ,   country   string );",

A sink configuration allows you to define a mapping to convert the Siddhi event to the required output data format (such as  JSON ,  TEXT ,  XML , etc.).\nWhen customization to such mappings is not provided, Siddhi converts events to its default format based on the stream definition and \nthe selected data format to publish the events.  Purpose  Sinks provide a way to publish Siddhi events to external systems in the preferred data format.   Syntax  To configure a stream to publish events via a sink, add the sink configuration to a stream definition by adding the  @sink  \nannotation with the required parameter values. The sink syntax is as follows:  @ sink ( type = sink_type ,   static_option_key1 = static_option_value1 ,   dynamic_option_key1 = {{dynamic_option_value1}} , \n     @ map ( type = map_type ,   static_option_key1 = static_option_value1 ,   dynamic_option_key1 = {{dynamic_option_value1}} , \n         @ payload ( payload_mapping ) \n     )  )  define   stream   stream_name   ( attribute1   Type1 ,   attributeN   TypeN );    Dynamic Properties  The sink and sink mapper properties that are categorized as  dynamic  have the ability to absorb attributes values \nfrom their associated streams. This can be done by using the attribute names in double curly braces as  {{...}}  when configuring the property value.   Some valid dynamic properties values are:    '{{attribute1}}'  'This is {{attribute1}}'    {{attribute1}}   {{attributeN}}      Here the attribute names in the double curly braces will be replaced with event values during execution.    This syntax includes the following annotations.  Sink  The  type  parameter of the  @sink  annotation defines the sink type that publishes the events. The other parameters to be configured \ndepends on the sink type selected. Some of these parameters are optional, and some can have dynamic values.   For detailed information about the parameters see documentation for the relevant sink.  The following is a list of currently supported sink types.

The  type  parameter of the  @map  annotation defines the map type based on which the event is mapped. The other parameters to be configured depends on the mapper selected. Some of these parameters are optional and some have dynamic values.     For detailed information about the parameters see the documentation for the relevant mapping type.   Tip  When the  @map  annotation is not provided,  @map(type='passThrough')  is used by default. This can be used when the sink publishes in the Siddhi event format, or when it does not need any mappings.   Map Payload  @payload  is an optional annotation used with the  @map  annotation to define a custom mapping. When the  @payload  annotation is not provided, each mapper\nmaps the outgoing events to its own default data format. By defining the  @payload  annotation you can configure mappers to produce the output payload with attribute names of your choice, using dynamic properties by selectively assigning \nthe attributes in your preferred format.   There are two ways you can configure the  @payload  annotation.    Some mappers such as  XML ,  JSON , and  Test  accept only one output payload using the following format:   @payload( 'This is a test message from {{user}}.' )    Some mappers such  key-value  accept series of mapping values defined as follows:   @payload( key1='mapping_1', key2='user : {{user}}')     Supported Mapping Types  The following is a list of currently supported sink mapping types:   WSO2Event  XML  TEXT  JSON  Binary  Key Value   Example  This query publishes events from the  OutputStream  stream via the  HTTP  sink. Here the events are mapped to the default  JSON  payloads and sent to  http://localhost:8005/endpoint \n using the  POST  method, with the Accept  header, and secured via basic authentication where  admin  is both the username and the password.  @ sink ( type = http ,   publisher . url = http://localhost:8005/endpoint ,   method = POST ,   headers = Accept-Date:20/02/2017 ,  \n   basic . auth . username = admin ,   basic . auth . password = admin ,   basic . auth . enabled = true , \n   @ map ( type = json ))  define   stream   OutputStream   ( name   string ,   ang   int ,   country   string );",

Therefore, in order to join two streams, they need to be connected to a window so that there is a pool of events that can be used for joining. Joins also accept conditions to join the appropriate events from each stream.  During the joining process each incoming event of each stream is matched against all the events in the other \nstream's window based on the given condition, and the output events are generated for all the matching event pairs.   Note  Join can also be performed with  stored data ,  aggregation  or externally  defined windows .   Syntax  The syntax for a join is as follows:  from   input   stream # window . window   name ( parameter ,   ...   )   { unidirectional }   { as   reference } \n          join   input   stream # window . window   name ( parameter ,    ...   )   { unidirectional }   { as   reference } \n     on   join   condition  select   attribute   name ,   attribute   name ,   ...  insert   into   output   stream   Here, the  join condition  allows you to match the attributes from both the streams.   Unidirectional join operation  By default, events arriving at either stream can trigger the joining process. However, if you want to control the \njoin execution, you can add the  unidirectional  keyword next to a stream in the join definition as depicted in the \nsyntax in order to enable that stream to trigger the join operation. Here, events arriving at other stream only update the \n window of that stream, and this stream does not trigger the join operation.   Note  The  unidirectional  keyword cannot be applied to both the input streams because the default behaviour already allows both streams to trigger the join operation.   Example  Assuming that the temperature of regulators are updated every minute. \nFollowing is a Siddhi App the controls the temperature regulators if they are not already  on  for all the rooms with a room temperature greater than 30 degrees.    define   stream   TempStream ( deviceID   long ,   roomNo   int ,   temp   double );  define   stream   RegulatorStream ( deviceID   long ,   roomNo   int ,   isOn   bool );  from   TempStream [ temp     30 . 0 ] # window . time ( 1   min )   as   T \n   join   RegulatorStream [ isOn   ==   false ] # window . length ( 1 )   as   R \n   on   T . roomNo   ==   R . roomNo  select   T . roomNo ,   R . deviceID ,   start   as   action  insert   into   RegulatorActionStream ;   Supported join types    Following are the supported operations of a join clause.    Inner join (join)    This is the default behaviour of a join operation.  join  is used as the keyword to join both the streams. The output is generated only if there is a matching event in both the streams.    Left outer join    The left outer join operation allows you to join two streams to be merged based on a condition.  left outer join  is used as the keyword to join both the streams.  Here, it returns all the events of left stream even if there are no matching events in the right stream by \nhaving null values for the attributes of the right stream.  Example  The following query generates output events for all events from the  StockStream  stream regardless of whether a matching \nsymbol exists in the  TwitterStream  stream or not.  \nfrom StockStream#window.time(1 min) as S\n  left outer join TwitterStream#window.length(1) as T\n  on S.symbol== T.symbol\nselect S.symbol as symbol, T.tweet, S.price\ninsert into outputStream ;        Right outer join    This is similar to a left outer join.  Right outer join  is used as the keyword to join both the streams.\nIt returns all the events of the right stream even if there are no matching events in the left stream.     Full outer join    The full outer join combines the results of left outer join and right outer join.  full outer join  is used as the keyword to join both the streams.\nHere, output event are generated for each incoming event even if there are no matching events in the other stream.  Example  The following query generates output events for all the incoming events of each stream regardless of whether there is a \nmatch for the  symbol  attribute in the other stream or not.  \nfrom StockStream#window.time(1 min) as S\n  full outer join TwitterStream#window.length(1) as T\n  on S.symbol== T.symbol\nselect S.symbol as symbol, T.tweet, S.price\ninsert into outputStream ;",

This defines whether the event matching should be triggered for every event arrival in the specified stream with the matching condition.   When this keyword is not used, the matching is carried out only once.     Siddhi also supports pattern matching with counting events and matching events in a logical order such as ( and ,  or , and  not ). These are described in detail further below in this guide.

Purpose  Tables allow Siddhi to work with stored events. By defining a schema for tables Siddhi enables them to be processed by queries using their defined attributes with the streaming data.

Primary keys are configured by including the  @PrimaryKey( 'key1', 'key2' )  annotation to the table definition. \nEach event table configuration can have only one  @PrimaryKey  annotation. \nThe number of attributes supported differ based on the table implementations. When more than one attribute \n is used for the primary key, the uniqueness of the events stored in the table is determined based on the combination of values for those attributes.  Examples  This query creates an event table with the  symbol  attribute as the primary key. \nTherefore each entry in this table must have a unique value for  symbol  attribute.  @ PrimaryKey ( symbol )  define   table   StockTable   ( symbol   string ,   price   float ,   volume   long );   Indexes  Indexes allow tables to be searched/modified much faster.

Purpose  Extensions are supported because, Siddhi core cannot have all the functionality that's needed for all the use cases, mostly use cases require \ndifferent type of functionality, and for come cases there can be gaps and you need to write the functionality by yourself.  All extensions have a namespace. This is used to identify the relevant extensions together, and to let you specifically call the extension.  Syntax  Extensions follow the following syntax;  namespace : function   name ( parameter ,   parameter ,   ...   )   The following parameters are configured when referring a script function.     Parameter  Description      namespace  Allows Siddhi to identify the extension without conflict    function name  The name of the function referred.    parameter  The function input parameter for function execution.     Extension types  Siddhi supports following extension types:    Function  For each event, it consumes zero or more parameters as input parameters and returns a single attribute. This can be used to manipulate existing event attributes to generate new attributes like any Function operation.  This is implemented by extending  org.wso2.siddhi.core.executor.function.FunctionExecutor .  Example :   math:sin(x)    Here, the  sin  function of  math  extension returns the sin value for the  x  parameter.    Aggregate Function  For each event, it consumes zero or more parameters as input parameters and returns a single attribute with aggregated results. This can be used in conjunction with a window in order to find the aggregated results based on the given window like any Aggregate Function operation.   This is implemented by extending  org.wso2.siddhi.core.query.selector.attribute.aggregator.AttributeAggregator .  Example :   custom:std(x)    Here, the  std  aggregate function of  custom  extension returns the standard deviation of the  x  value based on its assigned window query.     Window    This allows events to be  collected, generated, dropped and expired anytime   without altering  the event format based on the given input parameters, similar to any other Window operator.   This is implemented by extending  org.wso2.siddhi.core.query.processor.stream.window.WindowProcessor .  Example :   custom:unique(key)    Here, the  unique  window of the  custom  extension retains one event for each unique  key  parameter.    Stream Function  This allows events to be   generated or dropped only during event arrival  and  altered  by adding one or more attributes to it.   This is implemented by extending   org.wso2.siddhi.core.query.processor.stream.function.StreamFunctionProcessor .  Example :    custom:pol2cart(theta,rho)    Here, the  pol2cart  function of the  custom  extension returns all the events by calculating the cartesian coordinates  x     y  and adding them as new attributes to the events.    Stream Processor  This allows events to be  collected, generated, dropped and expired anytime  by  altering  the event format by adding one or more attributes to it based on the given input parameters.   Implemented by extending \"org.wso2.siddhi.core.query.processor.stream.StreamProcessor\".  Example :    custom:perMinResults( parameter ,  parameter , ...)    Here, the  perMinResults  function of the  custom  extension returns all events by adding one or more attributes to the events based on the conversion logic.

Siddhi also allows applications and users to query Siddhi via its Store Query API to interactively \nretrieve data from its in-memory and other stores.\n\n\nMain Modules in Siddhi\n\n\nSiddhi comprises four main modules, they are: \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSiddhi Query API\n : This allows you to define the execution logic of the Siddhi application as queries and definitions using POJO classes. \nInternally, Siddhi uses these objects to identify the tasks that it is expected to perform. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSiddhi Query Compiler\n : This allows you to define the Siddhi application using the Siddhi Streaming SQL, \n and then it converts the Streaming SQL script to Siddhi Query POJO Objects so that Siddhi can execute them. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSiddhi Core\n : This builds the execution runtime based on the defined Siddhi Application and processes the events as and when they arrive. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSiddhi Annotation\n : This is a helper module that allows all extensions to be annotated, so that they can be \npicked by Siddhi Core for processing. This also helps Siddhi to generate the extension documentation. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSiddhi Component Architecture\n\n\nThe following diagram illustrates the main components of Siddhi and how they work together. \n\n\n\n\nHere the \nSiddhi Core\n module maintains\nthe execution logic. It also interacts with the external environment and systems \nfor consuming and publishing events. To achieve these tasks, it uses the following components:  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSiddhiManager\n : \n  This is a key component of Siddhi Core that manages Siddhi Application Runtimes \n  and facilitates their functionality via Siddhi Context with periodic state persistence, statistics reporting and extension loading. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSiddhiAppRuntime\n : \n A Siddhi Application Runtime is generated for each Siddhi Application deployed. Siddhi Application Runtimes\n provide an isolated execution environment for each Siddhi Application defined.\n These Siddhi Application Runtimes are based on the logic of their Siddhi Application, and they consume and publish events from various external systems and Java or Python programmes. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSiddhiContext\n : \nThis is a shared object for all the Siddhi Application Runtimes within the a Siddhi manager, and it contains references \nto the persistence store for periodic persistence, statistics manager to report performance statistics of Siddhi Application Runtimes, \nand extension holders for loading Siddhi extensions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSiddhi Application Creation\n\n\nExecution logic in Siddhi is composed as a Siddhi Application, and this is passed as a string to \n\nSiddhiManager\n to create the \nSiddhiAppRuntime\n for execution. \n\n\nWhen a Siddhi Application is passed to the \nSiddhiManager.createSiddhiAppRuntime()\n, it is processed internally with the \n\nSiddhiCompiler\n. \nHere, the \nSiddhiApp\n String is converted to \nSiddhiApp\n\n object model by the \nSiddhiQLBaseVisitorImpl\n class. \nThe model is then passed to the \nSiddhiAppParser\n \nfor the \nSiddhiAppRuntime\n creation.\n\n\nSiddhi App Execution Flow\n\n\nFollowing diagram depicts the execution flow within a Siddhi App Runtime. \n\n\n\n\nThe path taken by events within Siddhi is indicated in blue. \n\n\nThe components that are involved in handling the events are as follows: \n\n\n\n\n\n\nStreamJunction\n\n\nThis routes events to various components within the Siddhi App Runtime. A stream junction is\ngenerated for each stream defined or inferred in the Siddhi Application. A stream junction by default uses the incoming event's thread\nfor processing subscribed components, but it can also be configured via the \n@Async\n annotation to buffer the events and \nuse a different thread for subsequent execution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInputHandler\n \n\n\nAn instance of input handler is created for each stream junction, and this is used for pushing \nEvent\n and\n \nEvent[]\n objects into stream junctions from sources, and Java/Python programmes. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nStreamCallback\n \n\n\nThis receives \nEvent[]\ns from stream junction and passes them to sinks to publish to external endpoints, \nor passes them to subscribed Java/Python programmes for further processing. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nQueries\n \n \nPartitions\n \n\n\nThese components process the events by filtering, transforming, joining, patten matching, \netc. They consume events from one or more stream junctions, process them and publish the processed events \ninto stream junctions based on the defined query or partition. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource\n \n\n\nSources consume events from external sources in various data formats, convert them into Siddhi events\nand pass them to corresponding Stream Junctions via their Input Handlers. A source is generated \nfor each \n@Source\n annotation defined above a stream definition. Each source consumes events from an external source in the data format configured for it. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSourceMapper\n \n\n\nA source mapper needs to be configured for each source in order to convert the format of each incoming event to that of a Siddhi event. \nThe source mapper type can be configured using the \n@Map\n annotation within the \n@Source\n annotation. When the \n@Map\n annotation is\nnot defined, Siddhi uses the \nPassThroughSourceMapper\n,\nwhere it assumes that the incoming message is already in the Siddhi Event format, and therefore makes no changes to the event format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSink\n \n\n\nSinks convert the Siddhi Events to various data formats and publish them to external endpoints. \nA Sink generated for each \n@Sink\n annotation defined above a stream definition to publish the events arriving \nto that stream. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSinkMapper\n\n\nA sink mapper is configured for each Sink in order to map the Siddhi events to the specified data format so that they \ncan be published via the sink. The sink mapper type can be configured using the \n@Map\n annotation within the \n@Sink\n\nannotation. When the \n@Map\n annotation is not defined, Siddhi uses \nPassThroughSinkMapper\n, \nwhere it  passes the Siddhi events in the existing format (i.e., the Siddhi event format) to the Sink.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable\n\n\nTables store events. By default, Siddhi uses the \nInMemoryTable\n \nimplementation to store events in-memory. When \n@Store\n annotation\nis used, it loads the associated Table implantation based on the defined \nstore\n type. Most table implementations are \nextended from the \nAbstractRecordTable\n \nabstract class for the ease of development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWindow\n\n\nWindows store events and determine when events can be considered expired based on the given window constrain. Multiple types of windows are\ncan be implemented by extending the \nWindowProcessor\n \nabstract class. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncrementalAggregation\n \n\n\nThis allows you to obtain aggregates in an incremental manner for a specified set of time periods.\nIncremental aggregation functions can be implemented by extending \nIncrementalAttributeAggregator\n. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrigger\n\n\nA triggers triggers events at a given interval to the stream junction that has the same name as the trigger.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQueryCallback\n\n\nA query callback receives notifications when events are emitted from queries. Then it notifies the event occurrence \ntimestamp\n, and classifies \nthe events into \ncurrentEvents\n, and \nexpiredEvents\n. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSiddhi Query Execution\n\n\nSiddhi \nQueryRuntimes\n\n can be categorized in to three main types: \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSingleInputStream\n: \n Queries that consist of query types such as filters and windows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoinInputStream\n:\n  Queries that consist of joins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStateInputStream\n: \n   Queries that consist of patterns and sequences. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing section explains the internals of each query type. \n\n\nSingleInputStream\n Query Runtime (Filter \n Windows)\n\n\n\n\nA single input stream query runtime is generated for filter and window queries. They consume events from a stream junction or a window\nand convert the incoming events according to the expected output stream format at the \nProcessStreamReceiver\n\nby dropping all the unrelated incoming stream attributes.\n\n\nThen the converted events are passed through a few Processors such as \nFilterProcessor\n,\n\nStreamProcessor\n, \n\nStreamFunctionProcessor\n, \n\nWindowProcessor\n\n and \nQuerySelector\n. \nHere, the \nStreamProcessor\n, \nStreamFunctionProcessor\n, and \nWindowProcessor\n can be extended with \nvarious stream processing capabilities. The last processor of the chain of processors must always be a \nQuerySelector\n, and each chain can \nhave only one \nWindowProcessor\n. When the query runtime consumes events from a window, its chain of processors cannot \ncontain a \nWindowProcessor\n.\n\n\nThe \nFilterProcessor\n is implemented with an \nExpressionExecutor\n \nthat returns a boolean value. Expressions have a tree structure, and \nthey are processed based on the Depth First Search algorithm. To achieve high performance,  Siddhi currently depends on the user\nto formulate the least successful case in the leftmost side of the condition, thereby increasing the chance of an early \nfalse\n detection.\n\n\nThe condition expression \nprice \n= 100 and ( Symbol == 'IBM' or Symbol == 'MSFT' )\n is represented as shown below.\n\n\n\n\nThese expressions also support the execution of user defined functions (UDFs), and they can be implemented by extending the \nFunctionExecutor\n class. \n\n\nAfter getting processed by each processor, each event reaches the \nQuerySelector\n for transformation. At the \nQuerySelector\n,\nevents are transformed based on the \nselect\n clause of the query. If there is a \nGroup By\n defined, then the \nGroupByKeyGenerator\n\nidentifies the group by key, and then each \nAttributeProcessor\n\nis executed based on that group-by key. \nAttributeProcessors\n can contain any expression including \nconstant values, variables and user defined functions. They can also contain \nAttributeAggregator\ns\nfor processing aggregation operations such as \nsum\n, \ncount\n, etc. Here, an \nAttributeAggregator\n is generated to \nkeep track of the aggregation state. When it becomes obsolete, it is destroyed. The events are transformed to the expected output format through this operation.  \n\n\nAfter an event is transformed to the output format, it is evaluated against the \nHavingConditionExecutor\n if a \nhaving\n clause is \nprovided. Only the succeeding events are pushed to the \nOutputRateLimiter\n.   \n\n\nAt \nOutputRateLimiter\n, the event output is controlled before sending the events to the stream junction or to the query callback. \nWhen the \noutput\n clause is not defined, the \nPassThroughOutputRateLimiter\n is used by passing all the events without any rate limiting. \n\n\nTemporal Processing with Windows\n\n\nThe temporal event processing aspect is achieved via \nWindow\n\nand \nAttributeAggregators\n\n\nTo achieve temporal processing,Siddhi uses the following four type of events: \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Events\n: Events that are newly arriving to a query from streams.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpired Events\n: Events that have expired from a window. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTimer Events\n: Events that inform the query about an update of execution time. These events are usually generated by schedulers. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nReset Events\n: Events that resets the Siddhi query states.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Siddhi, when an event comes into a \nWindowProcessor\n, \nit creates an appropriate expired event corresponding to the incoming current event with the expiring timestamp, and stores that \nevent in the window. The \nWindowProcessor\n  also forwards the current event to the next processor for further processing. \nIt uses a scheduler or such to determine when to emit the events it has in memory. During that time, it emits these events as expired events. If it needs to emit all the events in the memory at once, it emits a single reset event instead of sending one expired event for each event it has stored, so that it can reset the states in one go. For each current event emitted from a window, a corresponding expired event must be emitted. If not, a common reset event must be emitted.\n\nThis is vital in Siddhi because Siddhi relies on these events to calculate the Aggregations at the \nQuerySelector\n. \nIn the \nQuerySelector\n, the arrived current events increase the aggregation values, expired events decrease the values, and \nreset events reset the aggregation calculation.\n\n\nFor example, the sliding \nTimeWindow\n\ncreates a corresponding expired event for each current event that arrives,  adds that to \nthe window, adds an entry to the scheduler to notify when that event need to be expired by sending it a timer event, and \nfinally sends the current event to the next processor for subsequent processing.\n\nWhen the window receives an indication that the expected expiry time has come for the oldest event in the window via a \na timer event or other means, it removes the expired event from the window and passes that to the next processor. \n\n\n\n\nJoinInputStream\n Query Runtime (Join)\n\n\n\n\nJoin input stream query runtime is generated for join queries. This can consume events from two stream junctions and perform a join operation as depicted above. \nIt can also perform a join by consuming events from one stream junction and join against itself, or it can join against a \ntable, window or an incremental aggregation. When a join is performed with a table, window or incremental aggregation,\nthe \nWindowProcessor\n in the image is replaced with the table, window or incremental aggregation. No\n\nbasic processors are used on their side. \n\n\nThe joining operation is triggered by the events that arrive from the stream junction.\nHere, when an event from one stream reaches the pre \nJoinProcessor\n, it matches against all the available events of the other stream's \nWindowProcessor\n. \nWhen a match is found, those matched events are sent to the \nQuerySelector\n as current events, and at the same time, \nthe original event is added to the \nWindowProcessor\n where it remains until it expires. Similarly, when an \nevent expires from the \nWindowProcessor\n, it matches against all the available events of the other stream's \nWindowProcessor\n, and \nwhen a match is found, those matched events are sent to the \nQuerySelector\n as expired events.\n\n\nNote: Despite the optimizations, a join query is quite expensive when it comes to performance. This is because\n the \nWindowProcessor\n is locked during the matching process to avoid race conditions and to achieve accuracy while \n joining. Therefore, avoid matching large windows in high volume streams. Based on the scenario, \n using appropriate window sizes (by time or length) helps to achieve maximum performance.\n\n\nStateInputStream\n Query Runtime (Pattern \n Sequence)\n\n\n\n\nThe state input stream query runtime is generated for pattern and sequence queries. This consumes events from one or more stream junctions \nvia \nProcessStreamReceivers\n. A \nProcessStreamReceiver\n and a set of basic processors is defined in the query for each condition.\nWhen a \nProcessStreamReceiver\n consumes the events, it updates the states with the incoming events that are generated by previous conditions. If the condition applied\nis the first condition in the query, then it creates a new state and updates that with the incoming event. This is then passed \nto basic processors to perform filtering and transformation operations. The states \nthat pass the basic processors are consumed by the \nPostStateProcessor\n and stored at the \nPreStateProcessor\n of the following pattern or \nsequence condition. When the state reaches the final condition's \nPostStateProcessor\n, \nthe output event is generated and emitted by \nQuerySelector\n. \n\n\nSiddhi Partition Execution\n\n\n\n\nA partition is a wrapper around one or more Siddhi queries and inner streams that connect them. \nA partition is implemented in Siddhi as a \nPartitionRuntime\n,\nand each unique partition instance is implemented as a \nPartitionInstanceRuntime\n\nEach partitioned stream entering the partition\ngoes through the appropriate \nPartitionStreamReceiver\n.\nThe \nPartitionExecutor\n\n of stream receiver evaluates \n\nthe incoming events to identify the partition key using the \nRangePartitionExecutor\n\n or the \nValuePartitionExecutor\n,\n  and passes \nthe events to the \nQueryRuntimes\n of the appropriate \nPartitionInstanceRuntime\n based on the partition key. \nIf a \nPartitionInstanceRuntime\n is not available for the given partition key, it is dynamically generated via the relevant \nQueryRuntimes\n and \nInnerStreamJunctions\n. \n\n\nBased on the partition definition, the \nQueryRuntimes\n in the \nPartitionInstanceRuntime\n wire themselves via inner \nStreamJunctions\n or using \n\nStreamJunctions\n outside the partitions. \nWhen a partition query consumes a non partitioned global stream, all instances of its \nQueryRuntime\n that are part of multiple \nPartitionInstanceRuntimes\n\nreceive the same event as depicted in the above diagram. \n\n\nSiddhi Event Formats\n\n\nSiddhi has three event formats. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent\n \n\n\nThis is the format exposed to end users when they send events via Input Handler, and consume events via Stream Callback or Query Callback.\nThis consists of an \nObject[]\n that contains all the values in accordance to the corresponding stream. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nStreamEvent\n (Subtype of \nComplexEvent\n)\n\n\nThis is used within queries. This contains the following three \nObject[]\ns: \n- \nbeforeWindowData\n: This contains values that are only used in processors that are executed before the \nWindowProcessor\n.\n- \nonAfterWindowData\n: This contains values that are only used by the \nWindowProcessor\n and the other processors that follow it, but not sent as output.\n- \noutputData\n: This contains the values that comply with the output stream of the query.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to optimize the amount of data that is stored in the in-memory at windows, the content in \nbeforeWindowData\n is cleared before the \n    event enters the \nWindowProcessor\n. StreamEvents can also be chained by linking each other via the \nnext\n property in them.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nStateEvent\n (Subtype of \nComplexEvent\n)\n\n\nThis is used in Joins, Patterns and Sequences when we need to associate events of multiple streams, tables, windows and aggregations of different types together.\nThis has a collection of \nStreamEvents\n representing different streams, tables, etc, that are used in the query, and \noutputData\n to contain the values that are needed for the query output. \n\nStreamEvents\n can also be chained by linking each other with the \nnext\n property in them. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent Chunks\n\n\nEvent Chunks provide an easier way of manipulating the chain of \nStreamEvents\n and \nStateEvents\n so that they are be easily iterated, inserted and removed. \n\n\nSummary\n\n\nThis article focuses on describing the architecture of Siddhi and rationalizing the architectural decisions made. It\nalso explains the key features of Siddhi.\n\nThis is possibly a great starting point for new developers to understand Siddhi and to start contributing to it.",

The sink mapper type can be configured using the  @Map  annotation within the  @Sink \nannotation. When the  @Map  annotation is not defined, Siddhi uses  PassThroughSinkMapper , \nwhere it  passes the Siddhi events in the existing format (i.e., the Siddhi event format) to the Sink.    Table  Tables store events. By default, Siddhi uses the  InMemoryTable  \nimplementation to store events in-memory. When  @Store  annotation\nis used, it loads the associated Table implantation based on the defined  store  type. Most table implementations are \nextended from the  AbstractRecordTable  \nabstract class for the ease of development.    Window  Windows store events and determine when events can be considered expired based on the given window constrain. Multiple types of windows are\ncan be implemented by extending the  WindowProcessor  \nabstract class.     IncrementalAggregation    This allows you to obtain aggregates in an incremental manner for a specified set of time periods.\nIncremental aggregation functions can be implemented by extending  IncrementalAttributeAggregator .     Trigger  A triggers triggers events at a given interval to the stream junction that has the same name as the trigger.    QueryCallback  A query callback receives notifications when events are emitted from queries. Then it notifies the event occurrence  timestamp , and classifies \nthe events into  currentEvents , and  expiredEvents .",

They consume events from a stream junction or a window\nand convert the incoming events according to the expected output stream format at the  ProcessStreamReceiver \nby dropping all the unrelated incoming stream attributes.  Then the converted events are passed through a few Processors such as  FilterProcessor , StreamProcessor ,  StreamFunctionProcessor ,  WindowProcessor \n and  QuerySelector . \nHere, the  StreamProcessor ,  StreamFunctionProcessor , and  WindowProcessor  can be extended with \nvarious stream processing capabilities. The last processor of the chain of processors must always be a  QuerySelector , and each chain can \nhave only one  WindowProcessor . When the query runtime consumes events from a window, its chain of processors cannot \ncontain a  WindowProcessor .  The  FilterProcessor  is implemented with an  ExpressionExecutor  \nthat returns a boolean value. Expressions have a tree structure, and \nthey are processed based on the Depth First Search algorithm. To achieve high performance,  Siddhi currently depends on the user\nto formulate the least successful case in the leftmost side of the condition, thereby increasing the chance of an early  false  detection.  The condition expression  price  = 100 and ( Symbol == 'IBM' or Symbol == 'MSFT' )  is represented as shown below.   These expressions also support the execution of user defined functions (UDFs), and they can be implemented by extending the  FunctionExecutor  class.   After getting processed by each processor, each event reaches the  QuerySelector  for transformation. At the  QuerySelector ,\nevents are transformed based on the  select  clause of the query. If there is a  Group By  defined, then the  GroupByKeyGenerator \nidentifies the group by key, and then each  AttributeProcessor \nis executed based on that group-by key.  AttributeProcessors  can contain any expression including \nconstant values, variables and user defined functions. They can also contain  AttributeAggregator s\nfor processing aggregation operations such as  sum ,  count , etc. Here, an  AttributeAggregator  is generated to \nkeep track of the aggregation state. When it becomes obsolete, it is destroyed. The events are transformed to the expected output format through this operation.    After an event is transformed to the output format, it is evaluated against the  HavingConditionExecutor  if a  having  clause is \nprovided. Only the succeeding events are pushed to the  OutputRateLimiter .     At  OutputRateLimiter , the event output is controlled before sending the events to the stream junction or to the query callback. \nWhen the  output  clause is not defined, the  PassThroughOutputRateLimiter  is used by passing all the events without any rate limiting.",

            "text": "The temporal event processing aspect is achieved via  Window \nand  AttributeAggregators  To achieve temporal processing,Siddhi uses the following four type of events:     Current Events : Events that are newly arriving to a query from streams.    Expired Events : Events that have expired from a window.     Timer Events : Events that inform the query about an update of execution time. These events are usually generated by schedulers.     Reset Events : Events that resets the Siddhi query states.    In Siddhi, when an event comes into a  WindowProcessor , \nit creates an appropriate expired event corresponding to the incoming current event with the expiring timestamp, and stores that \nevent in the window. The  WindowProcessor   also forwards the current event to the next processor for further processing. \nIt uses a scheduler or such to determine when to emit the events it has in memory. During that time, it emits these events as expired events. If it needs to emit all the events in the memory at once, it emits a single reset event instead of sending one expired event for each event it has stored, so that it can reset the states in one go. For each current event emitted from a window, a corresponding expired event must be emitted. If not, a common reset event must be emitted. \nThis is vital in Siddhi because Siddhi relies on these events to calculate the Aggregations at the  QuerySelector . \nIn the  QuerySelector , the arrived current events increase the aggregation values, expired events decrease the values, and \nreset events reset the aggregation calculation.  For example, the sliding  TimeWindow \ncreates a corresponding expired event for each current event that arrives,  adds that to \nthe window, adds an entry to the scheduler to notify when that event need to be expired by sending it a timer event, and \nfinally sends the current event to the next processor for subsequent processing. \nWhen the window receives an indication that the expected expiry time has come for the oldest event in the window via a \na timer event or other means, it removes the expired event from the window and passes that to the next processor.",

This can consume events from two stream junctions and perform a join operation as depicted above. \nIt can also perform a join by consuming events from one stream junction and join against itself, or it can join against a \ntable, window or an incremental aggregation. When a join is performed with a table, window or incremental aggregation,\nthe  WindowProcessor  in the image is replaced with the table, window or incremental aggregation. No \nbasic processors are used on their side.   The joining operation is triggered by the events that arrive from the stream junction.\nHere, when an event from one stream reaches the pre  JoinProcessor , it matches against all the available events of the other stream's  WindowProcessor . \nWhen a match is found, those matched events are sent to the  QuerySelector  as current events, and at the same time, \nthe original event is added to the  WindowProcessor  where it remains until it expires. Similarly, when an \nevent expires from the  WindowProcessor , it matches against all the available events of the other stream's  WindowProcessor , and \nwhen a match is found, those matched events are sent to the  QuerySelector  as expired events.  Note: Despite the optimizations, a join query is quite expensive when it comes to performance. This is because\n the  WindowProcessor  is locked during the matching process to avoid race conditions and to achieve accuracy while \n joining. Therefore, avoid matching large windows in high volume streams. Based on the scenario, \n using appropriate window sizes (by time or length) helps to achieve maximum performance.",
