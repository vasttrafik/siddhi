The required dependencies can be downloaded from \nhere\n.\n* Create a new Java class in the Maven project.\n\n\nStep 2: Creating Siddhi Application\n\n\nA Siddhi application is a self contained execution entity that defines how data is captured, processed and sent out.  \n\n\n\n\nCreate a Siddhi Application by defining a stream definition E.g.\nStockEventStream\n defining the format of the incoming\n events, and by defining a Siddhi query as follows.\n\n\n\n\n  \nString\n \nsiddhiApp\n \n=\n \ndefine stream StockEventStream (symbol string, price float, volume long); \n \n+\n \n                     \n \n \n+\n\n                     \n@info(name = \nquery1\n) \n \n+\n\n                     \nfrom StockEventStream#window.time(5 sec)  \n \n+\n\n                     \nselect symbol, sum(price) as price, sum(volume) as volume \n \n+\n\n                     \ngroup by symbol \n \n+\n\n                     \ninsert into AggregateStockStream ;\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Siddhi query groups the events by symbol and calculates aggregates such as the sum for price and sum of volume \n  for the last 5 seconds time window. Then it inserts the results into a stream named \nAggregateStockStream\n. \n\n\nStep 3: Creating Siddhi Application Runtime\n\n\nThis step involves creating a runtime representation of a Siddhi application.\n\n\nSiddhiManager\n \nsiddhiManager\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nSiddhiManager\n();\n\n\nSiddhiAppRuntime\n \nsiddhiAppRuntime\n \n=\n \nsiddhiManager\n.\ncreateSiddhiAppRuntime\n(\nsiddhiApp\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Siddhi Manager parses the Siddhi application and provides you with an Siddhi application runtime. \nThis Siddhi application runtime can be used to add callbacks and input handlers such that you can \nprogrammatically invoke the Siddhi application.\n\n\nStep 4: Registering a Callback\n\n\nYou can register a callback to the Siddhi application runtime in order to receive the results once the events are processed. There are two types of callbacks:\n\n\n\n\nQuery callback\n: This subscribes to a query.\n\n\nStream callback\n: This subscribes to an event stream.\nIn this example, a Stream callback is added to the \nAggregateStockStream\n to capture the processed events.\n\n\n\n\nsiddhiAppRuntime\n.\naddCallback\n(\nAggregateStockStream\n,\n \nnew\n \nStreamCallback\n()\n \n{\n\n           \n@Override\n\n           \npublic\n \nvoid\n \nreceive\n(\nEvent\n[]\n \nevents\n)\n \n{\n\n               \nEventPrinter\n.\nprint\n(\nevents\n);\n\n           \n}\n\n       \n});\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, once the results are generated they are sent to the receive method of this callback. An event printer is added \ninside this callback to print the incoming events for demonstration purposes.\n\n\nStep 5: Sending Events\n\n\nIn order to programmatically send events from the stream you need to obtain it's an input handler as follows:\n\n\nInputHandler\n \ninputHandler\n \n=\n \nsiddhiAppRuntime\n.\ngetInputHandler\n(\nStockEventStream\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the following code to start the Siddhi application runtime, send events and to shutdown Siddhi:\n\n\n//Start SiddhiApp runtime\n\n\nsiddhiAppRuntime\n.\nstart\n();\n\n\n\n//Sending events to Siddhi\n\n\ninputHandler\n.\nsend\n(\nnew\n \nObject\n[]{\nIBM\n,\n \n100\nf\n,\n \n100L\n});\n\n\nThread\n.\nsleep\n(\n1000\n);\n\n\ninputHandler\n.\nsend\n(\nnew\n \nObject\n[]{\nIBM\n,\n \n200\nf\n,\n \n300L\n});\n\n\ninputHandler\n.\nsend\n(\nnew\n \nObject\n[]{\nWSO2\n,\n \n60\nf\n,\n \n200L\n});\n\n\nThread\n.\nsleep\n(\n1000\n);\n\n\ninputHandler\n.\nsend\n(\nnew\n \nObject\n[]{\nWSO2\n,\n \n70\nf\n,\n \n400L\n});\n\n\ninputHandler\n.\nsend\n(\nnew\n \nObject\n[]{\nGOOG\n,\n \n50\nf\n,\n \n30L\n});\n\n\nThread\n.\nsleep\n(\n1000\n);\n\n\ninputHandler\n.\nsend\n(\nnew\n \nObject\n[]{\nIBM\n,\n \n200\nf\n,\n \n400L\n});\n\n\nThread\n.\nsleep\n(\n2000\n);\n\n\ninputHandler\n.\nsend\n(\nnew\n \nObject\n[]{\nWSO2\n,\n \n70\nf\n,\n \n50L\n});\n\n\nThread\n.\nsleep\n(\n2000\n);\n\n\ninputHandler\n.\nsend\n(\nnew\n \nObject\n[]{\nWSO2\n,\n \n80\nf\n,\n \n400L\n});\n\n\ninputHandler\n.\nsend\n(\nnew\n \nObject\n[]{\nGOOG\n,\n \n60\nf\n,\n \n30L\n});\n\n\nThread\n.\nsleep\n(\n1000\n);\n\n\n\n//Shutdown SiddhiApp runtime\n\n\nsiddhiAppRuntime\n.\nshutdown\n();\n\n\n\n//Shutdown Siddhi\n\n\nsiddhiManager\n.\nshutdown\n();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the events are sent, you can see the output logged by the event printer.\n\n\nFind the executable Java code of this example \nhere\n \n\n\nFor more code examples, see \nquick start samples for Siddhi\n.",

This can be done by using the attribute names in double curly braces as \n{{...}}\n when configuring the property value. \n\n\nSome valid dynamic properties values are: \n\n\n\n\n'{{attribute1}}'\n\n\n'This is {{attribute1}}'\n \n\n\n{{attribute1}} \n {{attributeN}}\n  \n\n\n\n\nHere the attribute names in the double curly braces will be replaced with event values during execution. \n\n\n\n\nSink\n\n\nThe \ntype\n parameter of \n@sink\n defines the sink type that publishes the events. The other parameters to be configured \ndepends on the sink selected, some of those can also be optional and some can be dynamic values. \nFor detailed information about the parameters refer the appropriate sink documentation.\n\n\nSome of the supports sink types are:\n\n\n\n\nTCP\n\n\nKafka\n \n\n\nE-mail\n  \n(Only works in WSO2 Stream Processor)\n \n\n\nMQTT\n \n\n\nRabbitMQ\n \n\n\nIn-Memory\n\n\nFile\n \n(Only works in WSO2 Stream Processor)\n \n\n\nHTTP\n \n(Only works in WSO2 Stream Processor)\n \n\n\nJMS\n \n(Only works in WSO2 Stream Processor)\n  \n\n\nWSO2-Event\n \n(Only works in WSO2 Stream Processor)\n \n\n\n\n\nSink Mapper\n\n\nEach \n@sink\n will have a mapping denoted by \n@map\n that converts the Siddhi event to an outgoing message format.\n\n\nThe \ntype\n parameter of \n@map\n defines the map type that's responsible of mapping the event. The other parameters to be configured depends on the mapper selected, some of those can also be optional or dynamic values. \nFor detailed information about the parameters refer the appropriate mapper documentation.\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\nWhen \n@map\n is not provided \n@map(type='passThrough')\n will be used as default. This can be used when Sink can publish Siddhi events and when it does not need any mappings.\n\n\n\n\nMap Payload\n\n\n@payload\n is an optional parameter of \n@map\n to define a custom mapping. When \n@payload\n is not provided each mapper\nmaps the outgoing events to it's own default data format. By defining \n@payload\n you \ncan configure mappers to produce the output payload as of your choice using dynamic properties by selectively assigning \nthe attributes on your preferred format. \n\n\nThere are two ways you can configure \n@payload\n. \n\n\n\n\nSome mappers such as \nXML\n, \nJSON\n, and \nTest\n accepts only one output payload using the following format: \n\n\n@payload( 'This is a test message from {{user}}.' )\n \n\n\nSome mappers such \nkey-value\n accepts series of mapping values defined as: \n\n\n@payload( key1='mapping_1', key2='user : {{user}}')\n \n\n\n\n\nSome of the supports sink mappings are:\n\n\n\n\nJSON\n\n\nXML\n\n\nBinary\n\n\nText\n\n\nKey-Value\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nThe following query publishes events from \nOutputStream\n via the \nHTTP\n Sink. Here the events are mapped to default \nJSON\n payloads and sent to \nhttp://localhost:8005/endpoint\n\n using \nPOST\n method, \nAccept\n header, and basic authentication having \nadmin\n as both the username and the password.\n\n\n@\nsink\n(\ntype\n=\nhttp\n,\n \npublisher\n.\nurl\n=\nhttp://localhost:8005/endpoint\n,\n \nmethod\n=\nPOST\n,\n \nheaders\n=\nAccept-Date:20/02/2017\n,\n \n  \nbasic\n.\nauth\n.\nusername\n=\nadmin\n,\n \nbasic\n.\nauth\n.\npassword\n=\nadmin\n,\n \nbasic\n.\nauth\n.\nenabled\n=\ntrue\n,\n\n  \n@\nmap\n(\ntype\n=\njson\n))\n\n\ndefine\n \nstream\n \nOutputStream\n \n(\nname\n \nstring\n,\n \nang\n \nint\n,\n \ncountry\n \nstring\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuery\n\n\nEach Siddhi query can consume one/more streams and zero/one table, process the events in streaming manner and generate a\n output event to a stream or performs CRUD operation to a table.\n\n\nPurpose\n\n\nQuery enables you to perform Complex Event Processing and Stream Processing operations by processing incoming events one by one in the arrival order. \n\n\nSyntax\n\n\nAll queries contain an input and output section, some also contain a projection section.

as the output of the query. \nThe possible values are as follows:\n\n \nfirst\n : Only the first event processed by the query in the specified time interval/sliding window is emitted.\n\n \nlast\n :

When an input stream is connected to a window, snapshot rate limiting emits all the current events that have arrived and do not have corresponding expired events for every predefined time interval. \nIf the input stream is not connected to a window, only the last current event for each predefined time interval is emitted.\n\n\nThe following query emits snapshot of the events in a time window of 5 seconds every 1 second. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nfrom\n \nTempStream\n#\nwindow\n.\ntime\n(\n5\n \nsec\n)\n\n\noutput\n \nsnapshot\n \nevery\n \n1\n \nsec\n\n\ninsert\n \ninto\n \nSnapshotTempStream\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTables\n\n\nA table is a stored version of an stream or a table of events. It's schema is defined via the \ntable definition\n thats\nquite similar to a stream definition. These events are by default stored \n\nin-memory\n but Siddhi also provides store extension to work with data/events stored in various data stores through the \ntable abstraction.\n\n\nPurpose\n\n\nTables allow Siddhi to work with stored events. By defining a schema to table Siddhi enables them to be processed at queries using their defined attributes with the streaming data, and also interactively query the state of the stored events in the table.\n\n\nSyntax\n\n\nThe following is the syntax for defining a new table.\n\n\ndefine\n \nstream\n \nstream\n \nname\n \n(\nattribute\n \nname\n \nattribute\n \ntype\n,\n \nattribute\n \nname\n \nattribute\n \ntype\n,\n \n...\n \n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nThe following creates a table named \nRoomTypeTable\n with the attributes \nroomNo\n with \nint\n type, \ntype\n with \nstring\n type.\n\n\ndefine\n \ntable\n \nRoomTypeTable\n \n(\n \nroomNo\n \nint\n,\n \ntype\n \nstring\n \n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimary Keys and Indexes\n\n\nEvent tables can be configured with primary keys to avoid the duplication of data, and indexes for fast event access.\n\n\nPrimary keys are configured by including the \n@PrimaryKey\n annotation to the table configuration. The combined value of the primary key attribute should be unique for each entry saved in the table. This ensures that entries in the table are not duplicated.\n\n\nIndexes are configured by including the \n@Index\n annotation within the event table configuration. Each event table configuration can have only one \n@Index\n annotation. However, multiple attributes can be specified as index attributes via a single annotation. When the \n@Index\n annotation is defined, multiple entries can be stored for a given key in the table. Indexes can be configured together with primary keys. \n\n\nExamples\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring primary keys\nThe following query creates an event table with the \nsymbol\n attribute defined as the primary key. Therefore, each entry in this table should have a unique value for the \nsymbol\n attribute.\n\n\n\n\n@\nPrimaryKey\n(\nsymbol\n)\n\n\ndefine\n \ntable\n \nStockTable\n \n(\nsymbol\n \nstring\n,\n \nprice\n \nfloat\n,\n \nvolume\n \nlong\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring indexes\n\n\n\n\nThe following query creates an indexed event table named \nRoomTypeTable\n with the attributes \nroomNo\n (as an \nINT\n attribute) and \ntype\n (as a \nSTRIN\nG attribute). All entries in the table are to be indexed by the \nroomNo\n attribute.\n\n\n@\nIndex\n(\nroomNo\n)\n\n\ndefine\n \ntable\n \nRoomTypeTable\n \n(\nroomNo\n \nint\n,\n \ntype\n \nstring\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin\n\n\nSyntax\n\n\nfrom\n \ninput\n \nstream\n \nname\n#\nwindow\n.\nlength\n(\n1\n)\n \njoin\n \ntable_name\n\n    \non\n \ninput\n \nstream\n \nname\n.\nattribute\n \nname\n \ncondition\n \ntable_name\n.\ntable\n \nattribute\n \nname\n\n\nselect\n \ninput\n \nstream\n \nname\n.\nattribute\n \nname\n,\n \ntable_name\n.\ntable\n \nattribute\n \nname\n,\n \n...\n\n\ninsert\n \ninto\n \noutput\n \nstream\n \nname\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the time of joining, the event table should not be associated with window operations because an event table is not an active construct. Two event tables cannot be joined with each other due to the same reason.\n\n\nPurpose\n\n\nTo allow a stream to retrieve information from an event table.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\nExample\n\n\nThe following query performs a join to update the room number of the events in the \nTempStream\n stream with that of the corresponding events in the \nRoomTypeTable\n event table, and then inserts the updated events into the \nEnhancedTempStream\n stream.\n\n\ndefine\n \ntable\n \nRoomTypeTable\n \n(\nroomNo\n \nint\n,\n \ntype\n \nstring\n);\n\n\ndefine\n \nstream\n \nTempStream\n \n(\ndeviceID\n \nlong\n,\n \nroomNo\n \nint\n,\n \ntemp\n \ndouble\n);\n\n\n\nfrom\n \nTempStream\n \njoin\n \nRoomTypeTable\n\n    \non\n \nRoomTypeTable\n.\nroomNo\n \n==\n \nTempStream\n.\nroomNo\n\n\nselect\n \ndeviceID\n,\n \nRoomTypeTable\n.\nroomNo\n \nas\n \nroomNo\n,\n \ntype\n,\n \ntemp\n\n\ninsert\n \ninto\n \nEnhancedTempStream\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupported Event Table Operators\n\n\nThe following event table operators are supported for Siddhi.\n\n\nInsert into\n\n\nSyntax\n\n\nfrom\n \ninput\n \nstream\n \nname\n \n\nselect\n \nattribute\n \nname\n,\n \nattribute\n \nname\n,\n \n...\n\n\ninsert\n \ninto\n \ntable\n \nname\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo insert only the specified output event category, use the \ncurrent events\n, \nexpired events\n or the \nall events\n keyword between \ninsert\n and \ninto\n keywords.

However, it returns all the events of left stream even if there are no matching events in the right stream. Here each stream should be associated with a window. During the joining process, each incoming event of each stream is matched against all the events in the other input event stream window based on the given condition. Incoming events of the right stream are matched against all events in the left event stream window based on the given condition. An output event is generated for all the matching event pairs.

Extension will follow the following syntax;\n\n\nnamespace\n:\nfunction\n \nname\n(\nparameter1\n,\n \nparameter2\n,\n \n...\n \n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere the namespace will allow Siddhi to identify the function as an extension and its extension group, the function name will denote the extension function within the given group, and the parameters will be the inputs that can be passed to the extension for evaluation and/or configuration.  \n\n\nE.g. A window extension created with namespace foo and function name unique can be referred as follows:\n\n\nfrom\n \nStockExchangeStream\n[\nprice\n \n=\n \n20\n]\n#\nwindow\n.\nfoo\n:\nunique\n(\nsymbol\n)\n\n\nselect\n \nsymbol\n,\n \nprice\n\n\ninsert\n \ninto\n \nStockQuote\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtension types\n\n\nSiddhi supports following five type of extensions:\n\n\n1.Function Extension\n\n\nFor each event it consumes zero or more parameters and output a single attribute as an output. This could be used to manipulate event attributes to generate new attribute like Function operator. Implemented by extending \"org.wso2.siddhi.core.executor.function.FunctionExecutor\".\n\n\nE.g. \"math:sin(x)\" here the sin function of math extension will return the sin value its parameter x.\n\n\n2.Aggregate Function Extension\n\n\nFor each event it consumes zero or more parameters and output a single attribute having an aggregated results based in the input parameters as an output. This could be used with conjunction with a window in order to find the aggregated results based on the given window like Aggregate Function operator. Implemented by extending \"org.wso2.siddhi.core.query.selector.attribute.aggregator.AttributeAggregator\".\n\n\nE.g. \"custom:std(x)\" here the std aggregate function of custom extension will return the standard deviation of value x based on the assigned window to its query. \n\n\n3.Window Extension\n\n\nAllows events to be collected and expired without altering the event format based on the given input parameters like the Window operator. Implemented by extending \"org.wso2.siddhi.core.query.processor.stream.window.WindowProcessor\".\n\n\nE.g. \"custom:unique(key)\" here the unique window of custom extension will return all events as current events upon arrival as current events and when events arrive with the same value based on the \"key\" parameter the corresponding to a previous event arrived the previously arrived event will be emitted as expired event.\n\n\n4.Stream Function Extension\n\n\nAllows events to be altered by adding one or more attributes to it. Here events could be outputted upon each event arrival. Implemented by extending \"org.wso2.siddhi.core.query.processor.stream.function.StreamFunctionProcessor\".\n\n\nE.g. \"custom:pol2cart(theta,rho)\" here the pol2cart function of custom extension will return all events by calculating the cartesian coordinates x \n y and adding them as new attributes to the existing events.\n\n\n5.Stream Processor Extension\n\n\nAllows events to be collected and expired with altering the event format based on the given input parameters. Implemented by extending \"oorg.wso2.siddhi.core.query.processor.stream.StreamProcessor\".\n\n\nE.g. \"custom:perMinResults(arg1, arg2, ...)\" here the perMinResults function of custom extension will return all events by adding one or more attributes the events based on the conversion logic and emitted as current events upon arrival as current events and when at expiration expired events could be emitted appropriate expiring events attribute values for matching the current events attributes counts and types.\n\n\nAvailable Extentions\n\n\nSiddhi currently have several prewritten extensions as follows; \n\n\nExtensions released under Apache License v2 : \n\n\n\n\nmath\n:   Supporting mathematical operations \n\n\nstr\n:Supporting String operations \n\n\ngeo\n: Supporting geocode operations\n\n\nregex\n: Supporting regular expression operations\n\n\ntime\n: Supporting time expression operations\n\n\nml\n: Supporting Machine Learning expression operations\n\n\ntimeseries\n: Supporting Time Series operations\n\n\nkf\n (Kalman Filter): Supporting filtering capabilities by detecting outliers of the data.\n\n\nmap\n: Supporting to send a map object inside Siddhi stream definitions and use it inside queries.\n\n\nreorder\n: Supporting for reordering events from an unordered event stream using Kslack algorithm. \n\n\n\n\nExtensions released under GNU/GPL License v3 : \n\n\n\n\ngeo\n: Supporting geographical processing operations   \n\n\nr\n: Supporting R executions\n\n\nnlp\n: Supporting Natural Language Processing expression operations\n\n\npmml\n: Supporting Predictive Model Markup Language expression operations\n\n\n\n\nWriting Custom Extensions\n\n\nCustom extensions can be written in order to cater usecase specific logics that are not out of the box available in Siddhi or as an extension. \n\n\nTo create custom extensions two things need to be done.\n\n\n1.Implementing the extension logic by extending well defined Siddhi interfaces. E.g implementing a UniqueWindowProcessor by extending org.wso2.siddhi.core.query.processor.stream.window.WindowProcessor.\n\n\npackage\n \norg\n.\nwso2\n.\ntest\n;\n\n\n\npublic\n \nclass\n \nUniqueWindowProcessor\n \nextends\n \nWindowProcessor\n \n{\n\n   \n...\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.Add an extension mapping file to map the written extension class with the extension function name and namespace. Here extension mapping file should be named as \"\n.siddhiext\". E.g Mapping the written UniqueWindowProcessor extension with function name \"unique\" and namespace \"foo\", to do so the mapping file should be named as foo.siddhiext and the context of the file should as below; \n\n\n#\n \nfunction\n \nname\n \nto\n \nclass\n \nmapping\n \nof\n \nfoo\n \nextension\n\n\nunique\n=\norg\n.\nwso2\n.\ntest\n.\nUniqueWindowProcessor",

The flowing diagram depicts how  event flows  within some of the key Siddhi Streaming SQL elements \nof the Siddhi Application.   Below table provides brief description of a few key elements in the Siddhi Streaming SQL Language.     Elements  Description      Stream  A logical series of events ordered in time with a uniquely identifiable name and set of defined typed attributes defining it's schema    Event  An event is associated with only one stream, and all events of that stream have an identical set of attributes assigned specific types (or the same schema). An event contains a timestamp and set of attribute values according to the schema.    Table  A structured representation of stored data with a defined schema. Stored data can be backed by  In-Memory ,  RDBMs ,  MongoDB , etc to be accessed and manipulated at runtime.    Query  A logical construct that process events in streaming manner by combining existing streams and/or tables, and generates events to output stream or table. A query consumes one or more input streams and zero or one table, process those events in a streaming manner, publishes the output events to stream or tables for further processing or notifications.    Source  A contract that consumes data from external sources (such as  TCP ,  Kafka ,  HTTP , etc), converts it's data format (such as  XML ,  JSON ,  binary , etc) to Siddhi event, and passes that to a Stream for processing.    Sink  A contract that takes events arriving at a Stream, map them to a predefined data format (such as  XML ,  JSON ,  binary , etc), and publish them to external endpoints (such as  E-mail ,  TCP ,  Kafka ,  HTTP , etc).    Input Handler  A mechanism to programmatically inject events into Streams.    Stream/Query Callback  A mechanism to programmatically consumes output events from Streams and Queries.    Partition  A logical container that isolates processing of queries based on partition keys. Here separate instance of queries will be generated for each partition key to achieve isolation.    Inner Stream  A positionable stream that connects portioned queries within their partitions preserving isolation.     Grammar  The element of Siddhi SQL can be composed together as a script in Siddhi App, Here each construct should be separated \nby a semicolon ( ; ).   siddhi app   : \n         app annotation  * \n        (  stream definition  |  table definition  | ... ) + \n        (  query  |  partition  ) +\n        ;",

Purpose  By defining a schema it unifies common types of events together.

            "text": "Sources allow you to receive events via multiple transports and with various data formats into streams for processing.  Source let you define a mapping to convert the incoming event from its native data format (such as  JSON ,  TEXT ,  XML , etc) \nto Siddhi Event, when customization to such mappings is not provided Siddhi assumes that the arriving event adhere to a \npredefined format based on the stream definition and the selected message format.  Purpose  Source provides a way to Siddhi consume events from external systems and map the events to adhere to the associated stream.   Syntax  To configure a stream to consume events via a source, add the source configuration to a stream definition by adding the  @source  annotation with the required parameter values. \nThe source syntax is as follows:  @ source ( type = source_type ,   static . option . key1 = static_option_value1 ,   static . option . keyN = static_option_valueN , \n     @ map ( type = map_type ,   static . option_key1 = static_option_value1 ,   static . option . keyN = static_option_valueN , \n         @ attributes (   attributeN = attribute_mapping_N ,   attribute1 = attribute_mapping_1 ) \n     )  )  define   stream   stream_name   ( attribute1   Type1 ,   attributeN   TypeN );   Source  The  type  parameter of  @source  defines the source type that receives events. The other parameters to be configured \ndepends on the source selected, some of those can also be optional values. \nFor detailed information about the parameters refer the appropriate source documentation.  Some of the supports source types are:   TCP  Kafka    HTTP   (Only works in WSO2 Stream Processor)    MQTT    RabbitMQ    In-Memory  File   (Only works in WSO2 Stream Processor)    JMS   (Only works in WSO2 Stream Processor)     E-mail    (Only works in WSO2 Stream Processor)    WSO2-Event   (Only works in WSO2 Stream Processor)     Source Mapper  Each  @source  will have a mapping denoted by  @map  that converts the incoming message format to Siddhi event.  The  type  parameter of  @map  defines the map type that's responsible of mapping the data. The other parameters to be \nconfigured depends on the mapper selected, some of those can also be optional values. \nFor detailed information about the parameters refer the appropriate mapper documentation.   Tip  When  @map  is not provided  @map(type='passThrough')  will be used as default. This can be used when source consumes Siddhi events and when it does not need any mappings.   Map Attributes  @attributes  is an optional parameter of  @map  to define custom mapping. When  @attributes  is not provided each mapper\nassumes that the incoming events will be adhere to it's own expected default data format. By defining  @attributes  you \ncan configure mappers to extract data from the incoming message selectively and assign then to attributes.   There are two ways you can configure  @attributes .    Defining attributes as keys and mapping content as value in the following format:   @attributes( attributeN='mapping_N', attribute1='mapping_1')    Defining all attributes' mapping content in the same order as how the attributes are defined in stream definition:   @attributes( 'mapping_1', 'mapping_N')     Some of the supports source mappings are:   JSON  XML  Binary  Text  Key-Value   Example  The following query receives events via the  HTTP  source on  JSON  data format, and passes them in the  InputStream  stream for processing. \nHere the HTTP source is configured to receive events on all network interfaces on port  8080  on the context  foo , and \nits protected by basic authentication.  @ source ( type = http ,   receiver . url = http://0.0.0.0:8080/foo ,   is . basic . auth . enabled = true ,  \n   @ map ( type = json ))  define   stream   InputStream   ( name   string ,   age   int ,   country   string );",

            "text": "Sinks allow you to publish events from the streams via multiple transports to external endpoints with various data formats.  Sink let you define a mapping to convert the Siddhi event to appropriate output data format (such as  JSON ,  TEXT ,  XML , etc), \nwhen customization to such mappings is not provided Siddhi converts events to its default format based on the stream definition and \nthe selected data format and publish the events.  Purpose  Sink provides a way to publish Siddhi events to external systems in their preferred data format.   Syntax  To configure a stream to publish events via a Sink, add the sink configuration to a stream definition by adding the  @sink  \nannotation with the required parameter values. The sink syntax is as follows:  @ sink ( type = sink_type ,   static_option_key1 = static_option_value1 ,   dynamic_option_key1 = {{dynamic_option_value1}} , \n     @ map ( type = map_type ,   static_option_key1 = static_option_value1 ,   dynamic_option_key1 = {{dynamic_option_value1}} , \n         @ payload ( payload_mapping ) \n     )  )  define   stream   stream_name   ( attribute1   Type1 ,   attributeN   TypeN );    Dynamic Properties  The Sink and Sink mapper properties that are categorised as  dynamic  have the ability to absorb attributes values \nfrom their associated Streams. This can be done by using the attribute names in double curly braces as  {{...}}  when configuring the property value.   Some valid dynamic properties values are:    '{{attribute1}}'  'This is {{attribute1}}'    {{attribute1}}   {{attributeN}}      Here the attribute names in the double curly braces will be replaced with event values during execution.    Sink  The  type  parameter of  @sink  defines the sink type that publishes the events. The other parameters to be configured \ndepends on the sink selected, some of those can also be optional and some can be dynamic values. \nFor detailed information about the parameters refer the appropriate sink documentation.  Some of the supports sink types are:   TCP  Kafka    E-mail    (Only works in WSO2 Stream Processor)    MQTT    RabbitMQ    In-Memory  File   (Only works in WSO2 Stream Processor)    HTTP   (Only works in WSO2 Stream Processor)    JMS   (Only works in WSO2 Stream Processor)     WSO2-Event   (Only works in WSO2 Stream Processor)     Sink Mapper  Each  @sink  will have a mapping denoted by  @map  that converts the Siddhi event to an outgoing message format.  The  type  parameter of  @map  defines the map type that's responsible of mapping the event. The other parameters to be configured depends on the mapper selected, some of those can also be optional or dynamic values. \nFor detailed information about the parameters refer the appropriate mapper documentation.   Tip  When  @map  is not provided  @map(type='passThrough')  will be used as default. This can be used when Sink can publish Siddhi events and when it does not need any mappings.   Map Payload  @payload  is an optional parameter of  @map  to define a custom mapping. When  @payload  is not provided each mapper\nmaps the outgoing events to it's own default data format. By defining  @payload  you \ncan configure mappers to produce the output payload as of your choice using dynamic properties by selectively assigning \nthe attributes on your preferred format.   There are two ways you can configure  @payload .    Some mappers such as  XML ,  JSON , and  Test  accepts only one output payload using the following format:   @payload( 'This is a test message from {{user}}.' )    Some mappers such  key-value  accepts series of mapping values defined as:   @payload( key1='mapping_1', key2='user : {{user}}')     Some of the supports sink mappings are:   JSON  XML  Binary  Text  Key-Value   Example  The following query publishes events from  OutputStream  via the  HTTP  Sink. Here the events are mapped to default  JSON  payloads and sent to  http://localhost:8005/endpoint \n using  POST  method,  Accept  header, and basic authentication having  admin  as both the username and the password.  @ sink ( type = http ,   publisher . url = http://localhost:8005/endpoint ,   method = POST ,   headers = Accept-Date:20/02/2017 ,  \n   basic . auth . username = admin ,   basic . auth . password = admin ,   basic . auth . enabled = true , \n   @ map ( type = json ))  define   stream   OutputStream   ( name   string ,   ang   int ,   country   string );",

These events are by default stored  in-memory  but Siddhi also provides store extension to work with data/events stored in various data stores through the \ntable abstraction.  Purpose  Tables allow Siddhi to work with stored events. By defining a schema to table Siddhi enables them to be processed at queries using their defined attributes with the streaming data, and also interactively query the state of the stored events in the table.  Syntax  The following is the syntax for defining a new table.  define   stream   stream   name   ( attribute   name   attribute   type ,   attribute   name   attribute   type ,   ...   );   Example  The following creates a table named  RoomTypeTable  with the attributes  roomNo  with  int  type,  type  with  string  type.  define   table   RoomTypeTable   (   roomNo   int ,   type   string   );   Primary Keys and Indexes  Event tables can be configured with primary keys to avoid the duplication of data, and indexes for fast event access.  Primary keys are configured by including the  @PrimaryKey  annotation to the table configuration. The combined value of the primary key attribute should be unique for each entry saved in the table. This ensures that entries in the table are not duplicated.  Indexes are configured by including the  @Index  annotation within the event table configuration. Each event table configuration can have only one  @Index  annotation. However, multiple attributes can be specified as index attributes via a single annotation. When the  @Index  annotation is defined, multiple entries can be stored for a given key in the table. Indexes can be configured together with primary keys.   Examples   Configuring primary keys\nThe following query creates an event table with the  symbol  attribute defined as the primary key. Therefore, each entry in this table should have a unique value for the  symbol  attribute.   @ PrimaryKey ( symbol )  define   table   StockTable   ( symbol   string ,   price   float ,   volume   long );    Configuring indexes   The following query creates an indexed event table named  RoomTypeTable  with the attributes  roomNo  (as an  INT  attribute) and  type  (as a  STRIN G attribute). All entries in the table are to be indexed by the  roomNo  attribute.  @ Index ( roomNo )  define   table   RoomTypeTable   ( roomNo   int ,   type   string );",

If a taxi (i.e., a username) with an average speed greater than 60 that has not reached location at  latitude == 43.0096 and longitude == 81.2737  in 15 minutes is identified, an event is output to the  AlertStream  in order send an alert that indicates that the taxi has taken the wrong route.  Example 4: Detecting the non-occurence of multiple events  define   stream   LocationStream   ( username   string ,   latitude   double ,   longitude   double );  define   stream   StateStream   ( username   string ,   state   string );  from   not   LocationStream [ latitude   ==   43 . 0096   and   longitude   ==   81 . 2737 ]   for   30   minutes   and   not   StateStream [ state   ==   \u2018 finished \u2019 ]   for   30   minutes  select   \u2018 Danger \u2019   as   message  insert   into   AlertStream ;   This query receives information about the location of taxis from the  LocationStream  stream, and information about the status of the passenger from the  StateStream  stream.

After 30 minutes, it checkes whether the passenger has reached the location at  latitude == 43.0096 and longitude == 81.2737 , or marked to indicate that he/she is in danger. If the passenger has not reached the location, or if he/she has indicated that he/she is in danger, an event is output to the  AlertStream  stream in order to generate an alert to indicate that the passenger is in danger.  Example 7: Identifying the occurence of an unexpected event within a specified time interval  define   stream   TemperatureStream   ( temp   float ,   timestamp   long );  define   stream   FireAlarmStream   ( active   boolean );  from   not   TemperatureStream [ temp     60 ]   for   5   sec   -   e1 = FireAlarmStream  select   e1 . id   as   alarmId  insert   into   AlertStream ;   This query receives information about the temperature from the  TemperatureStream  stream, and information about the state of the fire alarm from the  FireAlarmStream  stream. If the state of the fire alarm is  active  within a period of 5 seconds during which the temperature is less than 60 degrees, an event is output to the  AlertStream  stream in order to indicate that the fire alarm generates false alerts.  Example 8: Identifying the non-occurence of an expected event within a specified time period  define   stream   TemperatureStream   ( temp   float ,   timestamp   long );  define   stream   FireAlarmStream   ( active   boolean );  from   TemperatureStream [ temp     60 ]   -   not   FireAlarmStream [ active   ==   true ]   for   5   sec  select   Fire alarm not working   as   message  insert   into   AlertStream ;   This query receives information about the temperature from the  TemperatureStream  stream, and information about the state of the fire alarm from the  FireAlarmStream  stream. If an event where the state of the fire alarm is  active  does not arrive within five seconds after an event that indicates that the temperature has risen above 60 degrees, an event is output to the  AlertStream  stream with  Fire alarm not working  as the message.  Example 9: Identifying the occurence of an even that is not preceded by another expected event  define   stream   LocationStream   ( locationId   string ,   customerId   string );  from   not   LocationStream [ locationId   ==   zoneA ]   and   e1 = LocationStream [ locationId   ==    billingCounter ]  select   e1 . customerId   as   customerId ,   Great deals are waiting for you at zone A   as   message  insert   into   NotificationStream ;   This query receives information about the location of customers from the  LocationStream  stream. If an event indicates that a customer has reached the  bilingCounter  location, and it is not preceded by an event that indicates that the same customer has been to the  zoneA  location, an event is output to the  NotificationStream  stream in order to generate a notification with  Great deals are waiting for you at zone A  as the message.",

Possible values are  INFO ,  DEBUG ,  WARN ,  FATAL ,  ERROR ,  OFF , and  TRACE . If no value is specified for this parameter,  INFO  is printed as the priority by default.    logMessage : This parameter allows you to specify a message to be printed in the log.    isEventLogged : This parameter specifies whether the event body should be included in the log. Possible values are  true  and  false . If no value is specified, the event body is not printed in the log by default.

Eval script functions can be defined like event tables or streams and referred in the queries as Inbuilt Functions of Siddhi.  Syntax  The following is the syntax for a Siddhi query with an Eval Script definition.  define   function   function   name [ language   name ]   return   return   type   { \n     operation   of   the   function  } ;   The following parameters are configured when defining an eval script.    function name :  The name of the function from another programming language that should be included in the Siddhi query.    language name : The name of the other programming language from which the function included in the Siddhi query is taken. The languages supported are JavaScript, R and Scala.    return type : The return type of the function defined. The return type can be  int ,  long ,  float ,  double ,  string ,  bool  or  object . Here the function implementer should be responsible for returning the output on the defined return type for proper functionality.     operation of the function : Here, the execution logic of the defined logos should be added. This logic should be written in the language specified in the  language name  parameter, and the return should be of the type specified in the  return type  parameter.    Examples   Concatenating a JavaScript function   The following query performs the concatenating function of the JavaScript language and returns the output as a string.  define   function   concatFn [ JavaScript ]   return   string   { \n     var   str1   =   data [ 0 ]; \n     var   str2   =   data [ 1 ]; \n     var   str3   =   data [ 2 ]; \n     var   responce   =   str1   +   str2   +   str3 ; \n     return   responce ;  } ;  define   stream   TempStream ( deviceID   long ,   roomNo   int ,   temp   double );  from   TempStream  select   concatFn ( roomNo , - , deviceID )   as   id ,   temp   insert   into   DeviceTempStream ;    Concatenating an R function   The following query performs the concatenating function of the R language and returns the output as a string.  define   function   concatFn [ R ]   return   string   { \n     return ( paste ( data ,   collapse = ));  } ;  define   stream   TempStream ( deviceID   long ,   roomNo   int ,   temp   double );  from   TempStream  select   concatFn ( roomNo , - , deviceID )   as   id ,   temp  insert   into   DeviceTempStream ;    Concatenating a Scala function   The following query performs the concatenating function of the Scala language and returns the output as a string.  define   function   concatFn [ Scala ]   return   string   { \n     var   concatenatedString   = \n      for ( i   -   0   until   data . length ) { \n          concatenatedString   +=   data ( i ). toString \n      } \n      concatenatedString  } ;  define   stream   TempStream ( deviceID   long ,   roomNo   int ,   temp   double );  from   TempStream  select   concatFn ( roomNo , - , deviceID )   as   id ,   temp  insert   into   DeviceTempStream ;",

            "text": "Siddhi supports an extension architecture to support custom code and functions to be incorporated with Siddhi in a seamless manner. Extension will follow the following syntax;  namespace : function   name ( parameter1 ,   parameter2 ,   ...   )   Here the namespace will allow Siddhi to identify the function as an extension and its extension group, the function name will denote the extension function within the given group, and the parameters will be the inputs that can be passed to the extension for evaluation and/or configuration.    E.g. A window extension created with namespace foo and function name unique can be referred as follows:  from   StockExchangeStream [ price   =   20 ] # window . foo : unique ( symbol )  select   symbol ,   price  insert   into   StockQuote   Extension types  Siddhi supports following five type of extensions:  1.Function Extension  For each event it consumes zero or more parameters and output a single attribute as an output. This could be used to manipulate event attributes to generate new attribute like Function operator. Implemented by extending \"org.wso2.siddhi.core.executor.function.FunctionExecutor\".  E.g. \"math:sin(x)\" here the sin function of math extension will return the sin value its parameter x.  2.Aggregate Function Extension  For each event it consumes zero or more parameters and output a single attribute having an aggregated results based in the input parameters as an output. This could be used with conjunction with a window in order to find the aggregated results based on the given window like Aggregate Function operator. Implemented by extending \"org.wso2.siddhi.core.query.selector.attribute.aggregator.AttributeAggregator\".  E.g. \"custom:std(x)\" here the std aggregate function of custom extension will return the standard deviation of value x based on the assigned window to its query.   3.Window Extension  Allows events to be collected and expired without altering the event format based on the given input parameters like the Window operator. Implemented by extending \"org.wso2.siddhi.core.query.processor.stream.window.WindowProcessor\".  E.g. \"custom:unique(key)\" here the unique window of custom extension will return all events as current events upon arrival as current events and when events arrive with the same value based on the \"key\" parameter the corresponding to a previous event arrived the previously arrived event will be emitted as expired event.  4.Stream Function Extension  Allows events to be altered by adding one or more attributes to it. Here events could be outputted upon each event arrival. Implemented by extending \"org.wso2.siddhi.core.query.processor.stream.function.StreamFunctionProcessor\".  E.g. \"custom:pol2cart(theta,rho)\" here the pol2cart function of custom extension will return all events by calculating the cartesian coordinates x   y and adding them as new attributes to the existing events.  5.Stream Processor Extension  Allows events to be collected and expired with altering the event format based on the given input parameters. Implemented by extending \"oorg.wso2.siddhi.core.query.processor.stream.StreamProcessor\".  E.g. \"custom:perMinResults(arg1, arg2, ...)\" here the perMinResults function of custom extension will return all events by adding one or more attributes the events based on the conversion logic and emitted as current events upon arrival as current events and when at expiration expired events could be emitted appropriate expiring events attribute values for matching the current events attributes counts and types.  Available Extentions  Siddhi currently have several prewritten extensions as follows;   Extensions released under Apache License v2 :    math :   Supporting mathematical operations   str :Supporting String operations   geo : Supporting geocode operations  regex : Supporting regular expression operations  time : Supporting time expression operations  ml : Supporting Machine Learning expression operations  timeseries : Supporting Time Series operations  kf  (Kalman Filter): Supporting filtering capabilities by detecting outliers of the data.  map : Supporting to send a map object inside Siddhi stream definitions and use it inside queries.  reorder : Supporting for reordering events from an unordered event stream using Kslack algorithm.    Extensions released under GNU/GPL License v3 :    geo : Supporting geographical processing operations     r : Supporting R executions  nlp : Supporting Natural Language Processing expression operations  pmml : Supporting Predictive Model Markup Language expression operations   Writing Custom Extensions  Custom extensions can be written in order to cater usecase specific logics that are not out of the box available in Siddhi or as an extension.   To create custom extensions two things need to be done.  1.Implementing the extension logic by extending well defined Siddhi interfaces. E.g implementing a UniqueWindowProcessor by extending org.wso2.siddhi.core.query.processor.stream.window.WindowProcessor.  package   org . wso2 . test ;  public   class   UniqueWindowProcessor   extends   WindowProcessor   { \n    ...  }   2.Add an extension mapping file to map the written extension class with the extension function name and namespace. Here extension mapping file should be named as \" .siddhiext\". E.g Mapping the written UniqueWindowProcessor extension with function name \"unique\" and namespace \"foo\", to do so the mapping file should be named as foo.siddhiext and the context of the file should as below;   #   function   name   to   class   mapping   of   foo   extension  unique = org . wso2 . test .
